    "text": "Note: This is a working draft that will continue to be edited. Last updated: 20 February 2024. Please refresh this manual every time you open it to ensure you are viewing the most recent version.\nIf you have questions/concerns regarding this guidance, please contact the FWS SA National Data Steward (sadatasteward@fws.gov) or Blake Massey (blake_massey@fws.gov).\n\n\nThis manual describes the requirements and best practices for the creation of high-quality and consistent metadata records for projects and products for USFWS Science Applications. These metadata requirements conform to the standardized metadata format agreed upon by the SA Data Management Working Group and meets USFWS policy requirements for data management. This metadata drives the unified SA Science Catalog, where SA projects and products are discoverable, accessible, and usable.\n\n\n\nMetadata creation is part of the Maintain step of the Data Management Lifecycle.\nGuidance is also available in the USFWS Data Management Handbook.\n\n\nThe metadata editing tool employed to create and support metadata requirements is mdEditor. This tool was an extension of an initiative by the Alaska Data Integration Working Group (ADIwg) and adopted by SA.\nThis manual refers to the creation of SA metadata specifically. If you want information on the creation of other metadata records using mdEditor, or more information in general, please refer to the mdEditor User Manual.\n\n\n\n\nThis guide is for anyone creating or updating metadata for SA-related projects and products. The primary purpose is to describe in detail how to develop metadata for items for inclusion in the SA Science Catalog, but the tool can also be used to track any project or funding.\nThe metadata requirements described here apply to science projects and products that were funded by SA (for more details, see the Project, Products, and Contacts section).\n\n\n\nDirectly accessing this manual from the internet is the recommended way to use this manual. By doing so, you will guarantee that you are using the current version since it is a live document and any updates can be made instantly. The online version will also have the best functionality and graphical display.\nIf needed, you can download this manual as a PDF and save a copy to your computer for printing or offline use. If you choose this method, be sure to reference the online version regularly and save a new PDF as updates are made to the online version. Also note that not all of the formatting will be exactly the same as the online version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSome of the stylized text boxes (like this one) will not translate to the PDF exactly. The text will still be outlined with a background color, but the icon above the text will not display in the PDF.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis manual was developed while mdEditor was also being developed. Due to this, there may be minor discrepancies between screenshots in the manual and the current production version of mdEditor."

Consult the Instructions for Testing Publishing section for more information. {% endhint %}\n\nDetermine your workflow for testing:\nIf you DO NOT already have items on ScienceBase. Choose a project and its products to test.\nBEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: It’s recommended that you export a project and its products into its own mdEditor file. Set default parent identifier as a ScienceBase folder.\nIf you DO already have items on ScienceBase, choose one of the following approaches. Note that this procedure may affect your existing records.\nApproach 1 - Take a simple project and product set, and make a copy of the mdEditor records. In the test version, delete all ScienceBase IDs (SBIDs) and parent IDs. The SBID will either be located in the citation, or if you imported the record from SB, the SBID will be the record identifier. Set default parent identifier as a folder.\nApproach 2- Publish directly to a real record if you have confirmed a backup copy exists, in the event that the record is deleted in ScienceBase.\nSet your Default Parent Identifier in Settings.\nSelect one project with its associated products to test.\nFollow the publishing instructions above for the scenario that applies to you.\nLook for any errors in the third column. If you see an error that is 400 and red, it’s a problem that you can address. However, if it’s a 500 level error in red, that is a ScienceBase error that is outside the scope of the mdEditor.\n\nNOTE: Any unsolvable issues can be submitted on the issues page for mdEditor: https://github.com/adiwg/mdEditor/issues. You must have a github account in order to post.\nAdvanced users can check errors using the console. Consult the Advanced Users section of this manual to learn more.\nVerify that your test records have published as expected in your folder on ScienceBase (or to the real record if that’s how you are testing).\nAfter you are satisfied with how your test records published to ScienceBase, continue to step 10.\nUpdate your mdEditor settings to your real Default Parent Identifier.\nUsing the record you just tested, proceed with publishing to the real location on ScienceBase.\nMake sure any test SBIDs are removed entirely from the record you want to actually publish.\nVerify that the real records have updated as expected.\nProceed with publishing your other records to their real locations. It is advisable to publish 1 or 2 records at a time, since ScienceBase can time-out and fail when publishing records simultaneously."

The lack of the LCC name in the funding source will muddle our ability to accurately understand funding moving forward beyond LCCs. As we move into SA-centric data management and even broader use of mdEditor, it will be even more vital to have clear indications of who provided funding.

See https://toolchain.gitbook.com/ for detailed instructions. The short version follows.\n{% hint style=“info” %} The following is required:\n\nNodeJS (v4.0.0 and above is recommended)\ngit\nA Markdown editor/IDE (ATOM is a good open source choice)\nWindows, Linux, Unix, or Mac OS X {% endhint %}\n\n\nInstall gitbook-cli using npm:\n $ npm install gitbook-cli -g\nClone the mdEditor GitBook:\n $ git clone https://git.gitbook.com/cookmt/mdeditor-for-lccs.git\nSetup GitBook\n $ cd mdEditor-for-lccs\n $ gitbook install\nStart the local GitBook server\n $ gitbook serve\nOpen a browser to: http://localhost:4000\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section covers styling conventions required for this documentations. Some of the conventions rely on plug-ins that enhance the native GitBook Markdown functionality. In some instances, the effects of the plugins are not displayed until after the book has been generated.\n\n\nPlease use headings to define page sections. Heading levels should appear sequentially without gaps (don’t skip heading levels). Headings should start at Level 1 for the page title. Headings should not be used purely to define font styles - if absolutely necessary, use CSS for that. Following this convention will make it possible to parse the markdown programmatically, e.g. to dynamically create a table of contents.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdered lists are processed irrespective of the actual number assigned to each list item. For Example:\n1. first\n2. second\n3. third\n{% hint style=“info” %} 1. first 2. second 3. third {% endhint %}\nis rendered the same as:\n1. first\n12. twelfth\n30. thirtieth\n{% hint style=“info” %} 1. first 2. twelfth 3. thirtieth {% endhint %}\nTherefore, one recommended convention is to use 1. for every item in an ordered list. This makes it easier to insert or remove items from the list, at the expense of slightly less readable Markdown. If you choose to sequentially order the list items, you must make sure the numbers are sequential to avoid confusion.\n\n\n\nHeadings may be use in lists. However, special handling is required to ensure bullets for ordered lists are styled appropriately.\nThe tasks tag is available for styling “task lists”. For simplicity, all of the various heading levels are styled the same.\nExample without task tag\n\n1. ## Level 2\n1. ### Level 3\n1. ###### Level 6\n{% hint style=“info” %} Example without task tag\n\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nLevel 6 {% endhint %}\n\nExample with task tag\n\n&lt;!-- tasks --&gt;\n1. ## Level 2\n1. ### Level 3\n1. ###### Level 6\n&lt;!-- endtasks --&gt;\n{% hint style=“info” %} Example with task tag\n\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nLevel 6 {% endhint %}\n\n\n\n\n\nFontAwesome icons are available. Use an &lt;i&gt; tag to render the chosen icon.\n&lt;i class=\"fa fa-smile-o\"&gt; &lt;/i&gt; Happy Birthday &lt;i class=\"fa fa-birthday-cake\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n{% hint style=“info” %} Happy Birthday {% endhint %}\n\n\n\nBootstrap 3 style buttons are supported. Use a &lt;span&gt; tag since these are for documentation only. Icons may be combined with buttons.\nDefault Primary Success Info Extra - Small Warning - Small Danger - Large Link\n&lt;!-- Standard button --&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"btn btn-default\"&gt;Default&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Provides extra visual weight and identifies the primary action in a set of buttons --&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"btn btn-primary\"&gt;Primary&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Indicates a successful or positive action --&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"btn btn-success\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"fa fa-check\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Success&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Contextual button for informational alert messages --&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"btn btn-info btn-xs\"&gt;Info Extra - Small&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Indicates caution should be taken with this action --&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"btn btn-warning btn-sm\"&gt;Warning - Small&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Indicates a dangerous or potentially negative action --&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"btn btn-danger btn-lg\"&gt;Danger - Large&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Deemphasize a button by making it look like a link while maintaining button behavior --&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"btn btn-link\"&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\nStyled hint blocks are supported.\n{% hint style='info' %}\nImportant info: this note needs to be highlighted\n{% endhint %}\nThere are five supported variations.\n\ninfo (default)\ntip\ndanger\nworking\nplain\n\n{% hint style=“info” %} Info: this note needs to be highlighted. {% endhint %}\n{% hint style=“info” %} Tip: 20% is customary. {% endhint %}\n{% hint style=“danger” %} Danger: this is going to blow up! {% endhint %}\n{% hint style=“info” %} Working: for the man every night and day… {% endhint %}\n{% hint style=“info” %} Plain: booooooorrrrring. {% endhint %}\n\n\n\n{% hint style=“info” %} The following software is required:\n\nLibre Office Draw\nA tool to capture screenshots\nWindows, Linux, Unix, or Mac OS X {% endhint %}\n\n\n\n\nbasic screenshots have no annotation or markup applied\nannotated screenshots have markup applied, e.g. callouts, highlights, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimum 1200px wide\nMust include a caption\nPNG format\nGenerally browser window captures should only contain minimum user interface controls, without navigation toolbar, tab bar, bookmarks toolbar, or status bar.

    "text": "We envision a well-functioning data management, integration, and sharing process that integrates, at minimum, the products of SA-funded projects with those from regionally-funded projects, and that support the data lifecycle in a coordinated manner.—Conservation Science Plan v.1\n\nIn the beginning, Science Applications was leading the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives: A network of individual, geographically distinct partnerships coordinated by SA. The 22 Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) developed uniquely and independently based on the needs of their regions and partnerships. As a result, there was not a single workflow for data management and sharing among the LCCs. Instead there were multiple workflows, varying formats, and different use cases for managing and sharing the results of LCC-funded projects. Further, because LCCs placed varying levels of importance on data management, LCCs varied greatly in their staff capacity for data management.\nWhile the individual workflows met the needs of the individual LCCs and their partner organizations, they were not enough to achieve the goal of a network-wide, integrated dynamic project and product database. Through collective agreement, LCCs agreed they needed to modify their workflows to create comparable project and product metadata.\nProcedurally, the LCC Network has committed to using ScienceBase for cataloging all funded projects and associated products. As per the LCC Network’s response to a DOI Office of the Inspector General 2017 report, individual LCCs must contribute their project and product metadata to the ScienceBase repository by the end of 2017 and mid-2018 respectively. In tandem with this ScienceBase requirement, the LCC Network is required to post data products to data.gov and this data conduit will be in place with products cataloged by end of 2018.\nWhile SA has refocused on FWS priorities, the need for data management, integration, and sharing process remains essential to mission of FWS and SA. This guidance was developed by the SA Data Management Working Group (DMWG) with the leadership of the Architecture Subgroup (ASG).\n\n\n\n\nObjective 1.1: Enable efficient and consistent searching and filtering across all SA projects and products&gt;\nObjective 1.2: Ensure resource managers and partners can continue to find and use LCC information and products for decision-making and conservation action on the landscape.\nObjective 1.3: Support users (e.g., resource managers, scientists, auditors, graduate students) in identifying remaining/future science needs and preventing future duplication of work by displaying who and what SA has funded.\nObjective 1.4: Ensure the SA Science Catalog instance will remain accessible through a portable design that can be hosted on fws.gov and elsewhere, if needed.\n\n\n\nObjective 2.1: Document how FWS and other sources of funding were used to fund science projects.\nObjective 2.2: Enable Science Applications and other key partners to show how FWS and other sources of funding were allocated to partners (e.g., states, tribes, federal agencies).\nObjective 2.3: Allow data managers to use the Science Catalog as an internal project tracking system.\n\n\n\nObjective 3.1: Enable Science Applications and other key partners to show how investments by FWS and other federal programs leveraged additional funding by partners.\nObjective 3.2: Demonstrate the depth and breadth of the projects and products produced by SA and the partners and collaborators involved.\n\n\n\nObjective 4.1: Link SA projects and products to overarching Conservation Issues."

    "title": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)\nA Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a globally unique, persistent, and resolvable identifier used to uniquely identify objects and are widely used to identify academic, professional, and government information (e.g., journal articles, research reports, data sets, official publications). Think of it as a Social Security Number for your data. DOIs are standardized by the International Organization of Standards (ISO). DOIs are connected to the asset in perpetuity through a DOI hosting service (e.g., DataCite or CrossRef) that maintains the link to the resource.\nDOIs should be assigned to Service-funded assets such as dataset, services, models, and reports, with the exception of research publications where journals assign the DOIs. Using DOIs promotes discovery and re-useability of the Service’s work and investments in data and ensures appropriate recognition for those collecting and properly managing data assets.\nFor more information on DOIs, see Digital Object Identifier Handbook.\nThe Service Digital Object Identifier Management Tool enables Service personnel to assign DOIs, registered with DataCite, to Service-funded data products and other resources. This tool is used to mint (create), update, publish, administer, and search for Service DOIs. DOI required metadata includes the asset title, creator(s), publication date, type of data product, abstract, dates relevant to the resource, and an online link to the permanent repository location of resource and can be updated at any time.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Anatomy of a DOI URL\n\n\nFigure 1 from Alaska Region Interim Data Management User Guide\nOnce minted, the DOI is included as an identifier in your metadata record (Figure 2)\n\nThis Tool was developed and is managed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Science Analytics and Synthesis (SAS) Science Data Management Branch, under an interagency agreement with the Service.\nDOIs generated by this tool should be assigned to Service-funded data products (such as data releases, services, models, and reports), with the exception of primary research publications published in one of the Service’s journals which are assigned through a process governed by the National Conservation Training Center. To generate data product DOIs, you need to submit brief citation metadata, including the title, creator(s), publication date, type of data product, abstract, dates relevant to the data, and an online link to the data. These citation metadata can be updated at any time.\nBefore you being, collect required metadata information as follows:\n\n\n\nMetadata\nRequired?\n\n\n\n\nTitle\nRequired\n\n\nResource Type\nRequired\n\n\nPoint of Contact\nRequired\n\n\nDate\nRequired\n\n\nAbstract\nRequired\n\n\nRepository URL\nRequired\n\n\n\n\nCreating and maintaining a DOI\nThe DOI Tool is designed to be user friendly and guide you through the process to mint, populate metadata, publish, and administer DOIs. It is important to note that there is both a “beta” and “live” version of the DOI. The beta version is useful as a training resource to become familiar with the DOI Tool.. The live version is where you go to actually create a DOI, which can be set to hidden or public. DOIs assigned through the live version have a prefix of 10.7944.\nTo login to the DOI Tool:\n\n  Use your Service email address and password. Once logged in, you will have “read-only” access to any record, “write” access to records that you created and to those where you have been added as a “Manager”.\n\n\nMinting a DOI\nMinting a DOI creates and reserves a DOI and DOI URL and does NOT require fully populated metadata fields. The benefit to minting the DOI early, such as in the Planning or Access Phase of the data lifecycle is efficiency. The DOI can be referencing in related documentation, metadata, and other elements of the project, reducing the need for updating later.\nTo mint a DOI, follow these steps:\n\n  Enter our existing metadata into the DOI Tool following the instructions provided on the site. New users are encouraged to review the “NEW USER?” section in the login page \\(Figure 1\\). The DOI does not need to be published publicly until the DOI metadata is completed.\n\n\n\n\nNew User Instructions on the Login Page\n\n\nThe DOI is comprised of the resolvable service url, the registered prefix and a product identifier suffix (Figure 2). Service DOI are assigned the prefix of 10.7964. The DOI URL can be used as a weblink to the registered asset.\n\n  Once created, the DOI is ready for use asset related metadata, reports, publications, and other elements that need to refer to DOIs as soon as necessary.\n  During the maintain phase of the data lifecycle, any empty fields in the DOI metadata should be updated.\n  Once the fields in the DOI metadata are fully populated, publish the DOI. This creates the digital tether to the URL for the data resource landing page.\n  You can administer the DOI at any time using the DOI tools dashboard\\(s\\). See the DOI Administration section below for more information.\n  Include the DOI as an identifier in your metadata record \\(Figure 2b\\).  As an identifier, only the prefix and suffix are needed.\n  Include the DOI as an online resource in your metadata record \\(Figure 2c\\).  In this case the entire DOI url is needed.\n\n\n\n\nINCORRECT DOI entry as identifier in metadata\n\n\n\n\n\nCORRECT DOI entry as identifier in metadata\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of DOI entered as both online resource and identifier\n\n\n\n\n\nDOI Administration\nThe Service has secured a large, yet limited bank (range) of DOIs. Once minted, the DOI is valid in perpetuity. If you are new to the DOI, please get familiar with the tool in the training beta version. When ready to officially reserve a DOI, use the live version of the tool. The DOI tool was not intended to be used do not for data assets that were not initiated, funded, or delivered as part of a Service project.\nTo date the Service has not identified a responsible party or governance for administering DOIs within the Service. As a result, the duties of DOI administration must fall to the collective of Service DOI creators/editors. DOI administration duties include:\nEnsuring minted DOIs are being used for their intended purpose, which includes:\n\nMinimizing the number of DOIs being minted and never published,\n\nEnsuring one DOI per digital object (e.g. research reports, data sets, service, etc.)\nEnsuring URL paths are still resolvable (no broken web links attached to the DOI)\n\nProviding usage reports\nHelping to reconcile previous DOIs from other DOI services\nEnhancing supplemental DOI metadata\n\nEach Service program, currently without enterprise level governance, has the option to administer the assignment of DOIs to their data assets within their program such that it meets their workflow. While the tool is available for any Service employee to login and create a DOI, a program may prefer to have a process to trigger a review or notification before a DOI is created. For example, an employee may login and create a DOI during planning set the DOI to hidden until the data and set edit rights to other accountable data staff. Once completed and approved, the DOI status can be set to public.\n\n\n\nExample of DOI Tool Dashboard\n\n\n\n\nBulk DOI Creation and Updates API\nThis tool also has an optional Web API (application programming interface) component for the automated creation and editing of DOIs and may be useful for bulk creation of DOIs through scripting/programming. After logging into the tool with your Department of Interior Active Directory credentials, see the DOI API link for more information.\n\n\n\nDOI API tool link indicated with red arrow"

    "text": "The following tutorial was developed by Matt Heller using the mdEditor File Injector script he developed, which can be used to do bulk edits on your mdEditor files. This demo specifically walks through how to add a Distribution Link. The injector script will look for a unique ScienceBase Identifier (SBID) that exists in the metadata and then build a URL for the Distribution / Online Option based on the SBID. The URL will be named “Product Web-page with Downloadable Files” and the Function selected will be “information.”\nA recording of this demo is available for viewing at: https://mmancusa.webex.com/mmancusa/ldr.php?RCID=b1a81ed0c41871e76f205d7f2f507008\n\n\n\nAccess to some mdEditor files. Note: these must be mdEditor files, NOT the mdJSON files attached to the SB items.\nPython installed on your PC.\n\nIf you have ArcGIS installed, there is a good chance Python is installed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to https://github.com/mmheller/mdEditorFileInjector and download all the files.\n\n\n\nUnzip to any folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a folder named Demo somewhere convenient.\n\n\n\nCopy/paste 2-5 of YOUR mdEditor files into the Demo folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen any text editor (e.g., notepad) and enter the following letters with Dashes on separate lines (–C –T –O)\n\n\n\nEnter the path to the Demo folder in line –C. Note: all files and files in subfolders will be processed by the script. No original files will be edited, copies will always be made.\n\n\n\nAdd False to the -T line. This indicates we’re not adding new contacts to the available contacts list.\n\n\n\nAdd 7 to the –O line. This specifies the option for the more complex find/replace\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack in the text editor, add two blank lines in the beginning.\n\n\n\nFind the path to your python.exe and enter in the 1st line. Example: C:.exe\nFind the path to your .py injector script file and enter in the 2nd line. Note: this will be in the folder you downloaded and unzipped. Example: C:-master_v1.py\n\n\n\nRemove all the carriage returns and extra spaces, and save if desired. Note: if any of your file paths have spaces, make sure to enclose the full path/filename with double quotes.\n\n\n\nOpen a DOS prompt.\n\n\n\nCopy/paste the text from your text editor into the command prompt to run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen mdEditor and clear the cache.\nClick Import. Go to the demo folder and into the new folder created. Note: each time the process runs it will create a new folder and add new files to this folder.\n\n\n\nSelect one of the new files to import.\nGo to Distribution. Click Edit Distributors green button where the pointOfContact = LCC Network Data Steward.\n\n\n\nClick Edit button in the Online Option section.\n\n\n\nNotice the injected fields. The Name of the online resource is “Product Web-Page with Downloadable Files” and the URL listed is the ScienceBase item link. The Function is “information” (since the link is not a direct download of the data).\n\n\nNote: If it errors out, there’s a problem. Verify the LCC Network Data Steward exists and the Contact ID matches edc6b779-3352-4a81-8430-76bcce1bfcb3"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Non Duplication Policy Guidance\n\nNon Duplication Policy\nBased on a 2017 OIG audit, minimal metadata fields are required to be published within 30-days of project funding. The purpose of this policy is to share information with partners regarding what science projects SA is supporting. This transparency helps to reduce duplication of efforts across funding agencies and allows partners to discover and engage in SA supported science as desired.\n\n\n\nQuick Reference: Project metadata for Non Duplication Policy\nRequired\n\n\n\n\nBasic Information: Title, Status\nRequired\n\n\nPoint of Contacts (see Main Tab: Project)\nRequired\n\n\nDescription: Abstract\nRequired\n\n\nTime Period\nRequired\n\n\nFunding: Award Number, amount, source, fiscal year, recipients\nRequired\n\n\n\nBelow is a copy of the Non Duplication Policy guidance memo, in detail for reference:\n\n\nGuidance for Preventing Duplication of Research and Other Science Activities\n\nBackground\nOn September 1, 2017, and December 7, 2017, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) issued memos detailing actions all Assistant Regional Directors, Science Applications (SA-ARDs), must take to prevent duplication of research across Science Applications and United States Geological Survey Climate Adaptation Science Centers (CASCs). This document provides further guidance for how to best comply with those memos, in addition to other measures that can be undertaken to prevent duplicative research across Science Applications, CASCs, and other federal programs. See this dashboard for a list of resources.\n\n\nSummary of Required Actions\nFor all financial assistance and inter-/intra-agency agreements or contracts for research projects and other science activities you must do what is outlined in the list below. Unless otherwise specified, the following applies to all science projects funded with SA applications monies (1410, 1420, and 1430):\n\nFirst determine if the project is a research project or other science activity. Consider whether the project will result in a science product (e.g. survey, study, tool, assessment, publication, etc.).\n\n\n If you decide that it IS NOT research or another type of other science activity, document your decision using [this template](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/NationalScienceApplicationsTeam/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BCBE94F78-67C1-478F-9A3A-DD264F031155%7D&file=SA_nonDup_policy_notScienceActivity_note_to_file_template_v2.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) and attach it to the official award file.\n\n\n\nIf you decide that it IS research or another type of science activity, proceed with the steps outlined below.\n\n Search for duplicative projects in ScienceBase \\(use the [ScienceBase search template](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/NationalScienceApplicationsTeam/Shared%20Documents/NonDuplication%20Policy%20Resources/All%20Other%20SA%20NonDuplication%20Policy%20Documents/Search%20Documentation%20Template_clean.docx?d=wfec340115ba14373b7cd9ecb92e309ac&csf=1&e=dyVjxv)\\).\nAdd this language to the NOFO: “Applicants must document literature searches (e.g. academic literature, industry publication, ScienceBase, and Data.gov). Applicants should explain why their project is non-duplicative and how it will augment existing knowledge.”\nInclude peer review as part of project selection.\nYou must document consultation with the appropriate CASC director(s). Send an email to Anna-Marie York (Anna-Marie_York@fws.gov) to obtain an electronic form to document consultation with CASC directors. The form link can be shared with anyone in the Department of the Interior and offers the ability to create a spreadsheet that summarizes responses, including a time stamp for when each respondent completed the form.\nAfter consultation with CASCs is complete, the SA-ARD must provide a memo to the file (template here) certifying that consultation occurred. (Note: for grants and cooperative agreements the ARD may instead certify consultation was done by checking the appropriate box and signing the New Award Checklist - FWS Form 3-2460). Include a copy of the spreadsheet of responses as part of the official award file.\n Enter all project information into ScienceBase as soon as possible, but within 30 days of the agreement being in place \\(required per [September 2017 memo](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/sites/NationalScienceApplicationsTeam/Shared%20Documents/General/Financial%20Resources/Non-duplication%20Policies/All%20Other%20SA%20NonDuplication%20Policy%20Documents/ClimateEffectsPrograms_042017_Public.pdf?CT=1586191476056&OR=ItemsView)\\). Provide as much information about projects as possible and update regularly, including adding entries for products within 30 days of receipt. See the ScienceBase Guidance section below for further details. \n\n\n\nRequired and Recommended Practices\nAs denoted by “(required)” in the list below, only practices 2, 5, and 6 are required per policy; the others are recommended but are not required. Note: required actions are the same as those listed above in the Summary of Required Actions. Unless otherwise specified, the following applies to all science projects funded with SA applications monies (1410, 1420, and 1430).\n\n Determine if the project is a research project or other science activity \\(required\\). Consider whether the project will result in a science product \\(e.g. survey, study, tool, assessment, publication, etc.\\).\n\n\n If you decide that it IS NOT research or another type of other science activity, document your decision using [this template](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/NationalScienceApplicationsTeam/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BCBE94F78-67C1-478F-9A3A-DD264F031155%7D&file=SA_nonDup_policy_notScienceActivity_note_to_file_template_v2.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) and attach it to the official award file \\(required\\).\n\n\n\nIf you decide that it IS research or another type of science activity, proceed with the steps outlined below.\n\n Consider coordinating with other federal agencies prior to the project funding phase:\n\nYou may consult informally during project development, or, when appropriate, invite staff from CASCs and other federal programs to be peer reviewers.\nWhen invited and able, consider participating in the project development and selection phases for other agencies’ research programs.\n\nSearch ScienceBase.gov for potentially duplicative projects prior to funding (required):\n\n\n Document your search of ScienceBase using the [ScienceBase search template](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/NationalScienceApplicationsTeam/Shared%20Documents/NonDuplication%20Policy%20Resources/All%20Other%20SA%20NonDuplication%20Policy%20Documents/Search%20Documentation%20Template_clean.docx?d=wfec340115ba14373b7cd9ecb92e309ac&csf=1&e=dyVjxv).\n\n\n\nDo multiple searches (i.e. varying search terms and criteria) as necessary.\nBe expansive in your search – use a variety of search terms and limit the scope only as necessary. You should not limit your search to CASC communities.\n\n\n\n Include copies of [ScienceBase search template](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/NationalScienceApplicationsTeam/Shared%20Documents/NonDuplication%20Policy%20Resources/All%20Other%20SA%20NonDuplication%20Policy%20Documents/Search%20Documentation%20Template_clean.docx?d=wfec340115ba14373b7cd9ecb92e309ac&csf=1&e=dyVjxv) and corresponding results \\(spreadsheet\\) in the financial award file.\n\n\n Repeat Practice 2 at [https://catalog.data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov) and any other relevant federal databases. You can use the [ScienceBase search template](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/NationalScienceApplicationsTeam/Shared%20Documents/NonDuplication%20Policy%20Resources/All%20Other%20SA%20NonDuplication%20Policy%20Documents/Search%20Documentation%20Template_clean.docx?d=wfec340115ba14373b7cd9ecb92e309ac&csf=1&e=dyVjxv) to document these searches, though note that some of the instructions on the template are specific to ScienceBase.\nInsert this language in NOFO: “Applicants must document literature searchers (e.g. academic literature, industry publication, ScienceBase, and Data.gov). Applicants should explain why their project is non-duplicative and how it will augment existing knowledge.”(required)\nConsult with CASCs once you have selected a project to fund, but prior to funding. Email Anna-Marie_York@fws.gov to obtain a link to a form to send to CASC directors (required).\n\nUse the results of ScienceBase searches, informal consultations, and/or serving on review panels to identify CASCs that have funded similar research. You may also consider any CASC in your project geography. Aim to be expansive.\nConsider sending the form to leadership from other federal agencies as well.\nUsing google forms will allow us to download a spreadsheet of time-stamped responses. Email Anna_Marie_York@fws.gov for a copy of the resulting spreadsheet.\nInclude a copy of the responses (spreadsheet) in the financial award file.\n\nAfter consultation with CASCs is complete, the SA-ARD must provide a memo to the file (template here) certifying that consultation occurred. (Note: for grants and cooperative agreements the ARD may instead certify consultation was done by checking the appropriate box and signing the New Award Checklist - FWS Form 3-2460). Include a copy of the spreadsheet of responses as part of the official award file.\n Enter all project information into ScienceBase as soon as possible, but within 30 days of the agreement being in place \\(required per [September 2017 memo](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/sites/NationalScienceApplicationsTeam/Shared%20Documents/General/Financial%20Resources/Non-duplication%20Policies/All%20Other%20SA%20NonDuplication%20Policy%20Documents/ClimateEffectsPrograms_042017_Public.pdf?CT=1586191476056&OR=ItemsView)\\). Provide as much information about projects as possible and update regularly, including adding entries for products within 30 days of receipt. See the ScienceBase Guidance section below for further details. \n\n\n\nScienceBase Guidance\n\nEvery region has folders in ScienceBase to put basic information about the science projects you have funded since September 30, 2017; per policy this is required within 30 days of funding a project or receiving a product. Here is what’s required for each project/product:\n\nTitle\nPI/funding recipient’s[1] name and contact info,\nPI/Funding recipient’s organization,\nstart date,\nprojected end date,\nabstract,\naward ID,\nfunding sources and amounts.\n\nYou can use mdEditor to make the records if that is your preference, or do it directly in ScienceBase. Here is a video tutorial showing how to enter directly on ScienceBase.\nIf you have a science activity that more than one FWS region contributed funds to, but there was a “lead region” that actually administered a single financial award / contract, then that lead region should create and maintain a single record in ScienceBase for the project and its products. The project record should list the total amount of Service funds in the financial / award contract (i.e., all regions combined).\nIf you have a science activity with multiple financial awards / contracts, then each award / contract should have its own ScienceBase record (note: modifications ARE NOT considered new awards / contracts). Whichever region administered each financial award / contract should create and maintain project and product records in ScienceBase. Please include the ScienceBase URL(s) for the related projects in the abstract. Example language: “this project is part of a larger initiative; you can find related records here: URL 1, URL 2, …”).\nIf you need “editing” access to your region’s ScienceBase folder…email Jill (jillian_cohen@fws.gov).\nIf you want a little more detail about what the “ScienceBase” policy is…Start with slides from a presentation Jill gave to the Data Management Working Group August 2018.\nIf you want all the details about the non-duplication policies…This dashboard is your gateway.\nIf you read through the slides and other documents and still have questions, or just want to check to make sure you’re doing things right…Call or email Jill (jillian_cohen@fws.gov; 703.358.1764).\n\n[1] The memo itself uses the term “project leader” instead of PI/funding recipient."

Click on ScienceBase.\nA login window will appear on the right side of the screen - enter your ScienceBase ID and password, and click Login. When you are logged in, the login window will display who you are logged in as. The current user must have read/write permissions on ScienceBase for any items to be published (including parent items). You cannot publish until you are logged in.\n\n\n\nYou will see a list of every valid record in mdEditor in the publishing outline with its ScienceBase Identifier (if the record already exists on ScienceBase) and its parent ScienceBase Identifier (if present in the metadata). This publishing outline shows records in a parent-child relationship and reflects what you would see when you publish to ScienceBase.\n{% hint style=“info” %} Remember: Parent-Child relationships refer to how the records are organized and displayed on ScienceBase. This is different than the Project and Product associations identified within the metadata records. {% endhint %}\n\nRecords without parent IDs already in their metadata will appear directly under the ScienceBase header in the publishing outline. These records will be published under the default parent identifier you established in the settings.

    "text": "We envision a well-functioning data management, integration, and sharing process that integrates, at minimum, the products of SA-funded projects with those from regionally-funded projects, and that support the data lifecycle in a coordinated manner.—Conservation Science Plan v.1\n\nIn the beginning, Science Applications was leading the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives: A network of individual, geographically distinct partnerships coordinated by SA. The 22 Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) developed uniquely and independently based on the needs of their regions and partnerships. As a result, there was not a single workflow for data management and sharing among the LCCs. Instead there were multiple workflows, varying formats, and different use cases for managing and sharing the results of LCC-funded projects. Further, because LCCs placed varying levels of importance on data management, LCCs varied greatly in their staff capacity for data management.\nWhile the individual workflows met the needs of the individual LCCs and their partner organizations, they were not enough to achieve the goal of a network-wide, integrated dynamic project and product database. Through collective agreement, LCCs agreed they needed to modify their workflows to create comparable project and product metadata.\nProcedurally, the LCC Network has committed to using ScienceBase for cataloging all funded projects and associated products. As per the LCC Network’s response to a DOI Office of the Inspector General 2017 report, individual LCCs must contribute their project and product metadata to the ScienceBase repository by the end of 2017 and mid-2018 respectively. In tandem with this ScienceBase requirement, the LCC Network is required to post data products to data.gov and this data conduit will be in place with products cataloged by end of 2018.\nWhile SA has refocused on FWS priorities, the need for data management, integration, and sharing process remains essential to mission of FWS and SA. This guidance was developed by the SA Data Management Working Group (DMWG) with the leadership of the Architecture Subgroup (ASG).\n\n\n\n\nObjective 1.1: Enable efficient and consistent searching and filtering across all SA projects and products&gt;\nObjective 1.2: Ensure resource managers and partners can continue to find and use LCC information and products for decision-making and conservation action on the landscape.\nObjective 1.3: Support users (e.g., resource managers, scientists, auditors, graduate students) in identifying remaining/future science needs and preventing future duplication of work by displaying who and what SA has funded.\nObjective 1.4: Ensure the SA Science Catalog instance will remain accessible through a portable design that can be hosted on fws.gov and elsewhere, if needed.\n\n\n\nObjective 2.1: Document how FWS and other sources of funding were used to fund science projects.\nObjective 2.2: Enable Science Applications and other key partners to show how FWS and other sources of funding were allocated to partners (e.g., states, tribes, federal agencies).\nObjective 2.3: Allow data managers to use the Science Catalog as an internal project tracking system.\n\n\n\nObjective 3.1: Enable Science Applications and other key partners to show how investments by FWS and other federal programs leveraged additional funding by partners.\nObjective 3.2: Demonstrate the depth and breadth of the projects and products produced by SA and the partners and collaborators involved.\n\n\n\nObjective 4.1: Link SA projects and products to overarching Conservation Issues."

This document provides further guidance for how to best comply with those memos, in addition to other measures that can be undertaken to prevent duplicative research across Science Applications, CASCs, and other federal programs. See this dashboard for a list of resources.\n\n\nSummary of Required Actions\nFor all financial assistance and inter-/intra-agency agreements or contracts for research projects and other science activities you must do what is outlined in the list below. Unless otherwise specified, the following applies to all science projects funded with SA applications monies (1410, 1420, and 1430):\n\nFirst determine if the project is a research project or other science activity. Consider whether the project will result in a science product (e.g. survey, study, tool, assessment, publication, etc.).\n\n\n If you decide that it IS NOT research or another type of other science activity, document your decision using [this template](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/NationalScienceApplicationsTeam/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BCBE94F78-67C1-478F-9A3A-DD264F031155%7D&file=SA_nonDup_policy_notScienceActivity_note_to_file_template_v2.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) and attach it to the official award file.\n\n\n\nIf you decide that it IS research or another type of science activity, proceed with the steps outlined below.\n\n Search for duplicative projects in ScienceBase \\(use the [ScienceBase search template](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/NationalScienceApplicationsTeam/Shared%20Documents/NonDuplication%20Policy%20Resources/All%20Other%20SA%20NonDuplication%20Policy%20Documents/Search%20Documentation%20Template_clean.docx?d=wfec340115ba14373b7cd9ecb92e309ac&csf=1&e=dyVjxv)\\).\nAdd this language to the NOFO: “Applicants must document literature searches (e.g. academic literature, industry publication, ScienceBase, and Data.gov). Applicants should explain why their project is non-duplicative and how it will augment existing knowledge.”\nInclude peer review as part of project selection.\nYou must document consultation with the appropriate CASC director(s). Send an email to Anna-Marie York (Anna-Marie_York@fws.gov) to obtain an electronic form to document consultation with CASC directors. The form link can be shared with anyone in the Department of the Interior and offers the ability to create a spreadsheet that summarizes responses, including a time stamp for when each respondent completed the form.\nAfter consultation with CASCs is complete, the SA-ARD must provide a memo to the file (template here) certifying that consultation occurred. (Note: for grants and cooperative agreements the ARD may instead certify consultation was done by checking the appropriate box and signing the New Award Checklist - FWS Form 3-2460). Include a copy of the spreadsheet of responses as part of the official award file.\n Enter all project information into ScienceBase as soon as possible, but within 30 days of the agreement being in place \\(required per [September 2017 memo](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/sites/NationalScienceApplicationsTeam/Shared%20Documents/General/Financial%20Resources/Non-duplication%20Policies/All%20Other%20SA%20NonDuplication%20Policy%20Documents/ClimateEffectsPrograms_042017_Public.pdf?CT=1586191476056&OR=ItemsView)\\). Provide as much information about projects as possible and update regularly, including adding entries for products within 30 days of receipt. See the ScienceBase Guidance section below for further details. \n\n\n\nRequired and Recommended Practices\nAs denoted by “(required)” in the list below, only practices 2, 5, and 6 are required per policy; the others are recommended but are not required. Note: required actions are the same as those listed above in the Summary of Required Actions. Unless otherwise specified, the following applies to all science projects funded with SA applications monies (1410, 1420, and 1430).\n\n Determine if the project is a research project or other science activity \\(required\\). Consider whether the project will result in a science product \\(e.g. survey, study, tool, assessment, publication, etc.\\).\n\n\n If you decide that it IS NOT research or another type of other science activity, document your decision using [this template](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/NationalScienceApplicationsTeam/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BCBE94F78-67C1-478F-9A3A-DD264F031155%7D&file=SA_nonDup_policy_notScienceActivity_note_to_file_template_v2.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) and attach it to the official award file \\(required\\).\n\n\n\nIf you decide that it IS research or another type of science activity, proceed with the steps outlined below.\n\n Consider coordinating with other federal agencies prior to the project funding phase:\n\nYou may consult informally during project development, or, when appropriate, invite staff from CASCs and other federal programs to be peer reviewers.\nWhen invited and able, consider participating in the project development and selection phases for other agencies’ research programs.\n\nSearch ScienceBase.gov for potentially duplicative projects prior to funding (required):\n\n\n Document your search of ScienceBase using the [ScienceBase search template](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/NationalScienceApplicationsTeam/Shared%20Documents/NonDuplication%20Policy%20Resources/All%20Other%20SA%20NonDuplication%20Policy%20Documents/Search%20Documentation%20Template_clean.docx?d=wfec340115ba14373b7cd9ecb92e309ac&csf=1&e=dyVjxv).\n\n\n\nDo multiple searches (i.e. varying search terms and criteria) as necessary.\nBe expansive in your search – use a variety of search terms and limit the scope only as necessary. You should not limit your search to CASC communities.\n\n\n\n Include copies of [ScienceBase search template](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/NationalScienceApplicationsTeam/Shared%20Documents/NonDuplication%20Policy%20Resources/All%20Other%20SA%20NonDuplication%20Policy%20Documents/Search%20Documentation%20Template_clean.docx?d=wfec340115ba14373b7cd9ecb92e309ac&csf=1&e=dyVjxv) and corresponding results \\(spreadsheet\\) in the financial award file.\n\n\n Repeat Practice 2 at [https://catalog.data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov) and any other relevant federal databases. You can use the [ScienceBase search template](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/NationalScienceApplicationsTeam/Shared%20Documents/NonDuplication%20Policy%20Resources/All%20Other%20SA%20NonDuplication%20Policy%20Documents/Search%20Documentation%20Template_clean.docx?d=wfec340115ba14373b7cd9ecb92e309ac&csf=1&e=dyVjxv) to document these searches, though note that some of the instructions on the template are specific to ScienceBase.\nInsert this language in NOFO: “Applicants must document literature searchers (e.g. academic literature, industry publication, ScienceBase, and Data.gov). Applicants should explain why their project is non-duplicative and how it will augment existing knowledge.”(required)\nConsult with CASCs once you have selected a project to fund, but prior to funding. Email Anna-Marie_York@fws.gov to obtain a link to a form to send to CASC directors (required).\n\nUse the results of ScienceBase searches, informal consultations, and/or serving on review panels to identify CASCs that have funded similar research. You may also consider any CASC in your project geography. Aim to be expansive.\nConsider sending the form to leadership from other federal agencies as well.\nUsing google forms will allow us to download a spreadsheet of time-stamped responses. Email Anna_Marie_York@fws.gov for a copy of the resulting spreadsheet.\nInclude a copy of the responses (spreadsheet) in the financial award file.\n\nAfter consultation with CASCs is complete, the SA-ARD must provide a memo to the file (template here) certifying that consultation occurred. (Note: for grants and cooperative agreements the ARD may instead certify consultation was done by checking the appropriate box and signing the New Award Checklist - FWS Form 3-2460). Include a copy of the spreadsheet of responses as part of the official award file.\n Enter all project information into ScienceBase as soon as possible, but within 30 days of the agreement being in place \\(required per [September 2017 memo](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/sites/NationalScienceApplicationsTeam/Shared%20Documents/General/Financial%20Resources/Non-duplication%20Policies/All%20Other%20SA%20NonDuplication%20Policy%20Documents/ClimateEffectsPrograms_042017_Public.pdf?CT=1586191476056&OR=ItemsView)\\). Provide as much information about projects as possible and update regularly, including adding entries for products within 30 days of receipt. See the ScienceBase Guidance section below for further details. \n\n\n\nScienceBase Guidance\n\nEvery region has folders in ScienceBase to put basic information about the science projects you have funded since September 30, 2017; per policy this is required within 30 days of funding a project or receiving a product. Here is what’s required for each project/product:\n\nTitle\nPI/funding recipient’s[1] name and contact info,\nPI/Funding recipient’s organization,\nstart date,\nprojected end date,\nabstract,\naward ID,\nfunding sources and amounts.\n\nYou can use mdEditor to make the records if that is your preference, or do it directly in ScienceBase. Here is a video tutorial showing how to enter directly on ScienceBase.\nIf you have a science activity that more than one FWS region contributed funds to, but there was a “lead region” that actually administered a single financial award / contract, then that lead region should create and maintain a single record in ScienceBase for the project and its products. The project record should list the total amount of Service funds in the financial / award contract (i.e., all regions combined).\nIf you have a science activity with multiple financial awards / contracts, then each award / contract should have its own ScienceBase record (note: modifications ARE NOT considered new awards / contracts). Whichever region administered each financial award / contract should create and maintain project and product records in ScienceBase. Please include the ScienceBase URL(s) for the related projects in the abstract. Example language: “this project is part of a larger initiative; you can find related records here: URL 1, URL 2, …”).\nIf you need “editing” access to your region’s ScienceBase folder…email Jill (jillian_cohen@fws.gov).\nIf you want a little more detail about what the “ScienceBase” policy is…Start with slides from a presentation Jill gave to the Data Management Working Group August 2018.\nIf you want all the details about the non-duplication policies…This dashboard is your gateway.\nIf you read through the slides and other documents and still have questions, or just want to check to make sure you’re doing things right…Call or email Jill (jillian_cohen@fws.gov; 703.358.1764).\n\n[1] The memo itself uses the term “project leader” instead of PI/funding recipient."

    "text": "We envision a well-functioning data management, integration, and sharing process that integrates, at minimum, the products of SA-funded projects with those from regionally-funded projects, and that support the data lifecycle in a coordinated manner.—Conservation Science Plan v.1\n\nIn the beginning, Science Applications was leading the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives: A network of individual, geographically distinct partnerships coordinated by SA. The 22 Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) developed uniquely and independently based on the needs of their regions and partnerships. As a result, there was not a single workflow for data management and sharing among the LCCs. Instead there were multiple workflows, varying formats, and different use cases for managing and sharing the results of LCC-funded projects. Further, because LCCs placed varying levels of importance on data management, LCCs varied greatly in their staff capacity for data management.\nWhile the individual workflows met the needs of the individual LCCs and their partner organizations, they were not enough to achieve the goal of a network-wide, integrated dynamic project and product database. Through collective agreement, LCCs agreed they needed to modify their workflows to create comparable project and product metadata.\nProcedurally, the LCC Network has committed to using ScienceBase for cataloging all funded projects and associated products. As per the LCC Network’s response to a DOI Office of the Inspector General 2017 report, individual LCCs must contribute their project and product metadata to the ScienceBase repository by the end of 2017 and mid-2018 respectively. In tandem with this ScienceBase requirement, the LCC Network is required to post data products to data.gov and this data conduit will be in place with products cataloged by end of 2018.\nWhile SA has refocused on FWS priorities, the need for data management, integration, and sharing process remains essential to mission of FWS and SA. This guidance was developed by the SA Data Management Working Group (DMWG) with the leadership of the Architecture Subgroup (ASG).\n\n\n\n\nObjective 1.1: Enable efficient and consistent searching and filtering across all SA projects and products&gt;\nObjective 1.2: Ensure resource managers and partners can continue to find and use LCC information and products for decision-making and conservation action on the landscape.\nObjective 1.3: Support users (e.g., resource managers, scientists, auditors, graduate students) in identifying remaining/future science needs and preventing future duplication of work by displaying who and what SA has funded.\nObjective 1.4: Ensure the SA Science Catalog instance will remain accessible through a portable design that can be hosted on fws.gov and elsewhere, if needed.\n\n\n\nObjective 2.1: Document how FWS and other sources of funding were used to fund science projects.\nObjective 2.2: Enable Science Applications and other key partners to show how FWS and other sources of funding were allocated to partners (e.g., states, tribes, federal agencies).\nObjective 2.3: Allow data managers to use the Science Catalog as an internal project tracking system.\n\n\n\nObjective 3.1: Enable Science Applications and other key partners to show how investments by FWS and other federal programs leveraged additional funding by partners.\nObjective 3.2: Demonstrate the depth and breadth of the projects and products produced by SA and the partners and collaborators involved.\n\n\n\nObjective 4.1: Link SA projects and products to overarching Conservation Issues."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Non Duplication Policy Guidance\n\nNon Duplication Policy\nBased on a 2017 OIG audit, minimal metadata fields are required to be published within 30-days of project funding. The purpose of this policy is to share information with partners regarding what science projects SA is supporting. This transparency helps to reduce duplication of efforts across funding agencies and allows partners to discover and engage in SA supported science as desired.\n\n\n\nQuick Reference: Project metadata for Non Duplication Policy\nRequired\n\n\n\n\nBasic Information: Title, Status\nRequired\n\n\nPoint of Contacts (see Main Tab: Project)\nRequired\n\n\nDescription: Abstract\nRequired\n\n\nTime Period\nRequired\n\n\nFunding: Award Number, amount, source, fiscal year, recipients\nRequired\n\n\n\nBelow is a copy of the Non Duplication Policy guidance memo, in detail for reference:\n\n\nGuidance for Preventing Duplication of Research and Other Science Activities\n\nBackground\nOn September 1, 2017, and December 7, 2017, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) issued memos detailing actions all Assistant Regional Directors, Science Applications (SA-ARDs), must take to prevent duplication of research across Science Applications and United States Geological Survey Climate Adaptation Science Centers (CASCs). This document provides further guidance for how to best comply with those memos, in addition to other measures that can be undertaken to prevent duplicative research across Science Applications, CASCs, and other federal programs. See this dashboard for a list of resources.\n\n\nSummary of Required Actions\nFor all financial assistance and inter-/intra-agency agreements or contracts for research projects and other science activities you must do what is outlined in the list below. Unless otherwise specified, the following applies to all science projects funded with SA applications monies (1410, 1420, and 1430):\n\nFirst determine if the project is a research project or other science activity. Consider whether the project will result in a science product (e.g. survey, study, tool, assessment, publication, etc.).\n\n\nIf you decide that it IS NOT research or another type of other science activity, document your decision using this template and attach it to the official award file.\n\n\nIf you decide that it IS research or another type of science activity, proceed with the steps outlined below.\nSearch for duplicative projects in ScienceBase (use the ScienceBase search template).\nAdd this language to the NOFO: “Applicants must document literature searches (e.g. academic literature, industry publication, ScienceBase, and Data.gov). Applicants should explain why their project is non-duplicative and how it will augment existing knowledge.”\nInclude peer review as part of project selection.\nYou must document consultation with the appropriate CASC director(s). Send an email to Anna-Marie York (Anna-Marie_York@fws.gov) to obtain an electronic form to document consultation with CASC directors. The form link can be shared with anyone in the Department of the Interior and offers the ability to create a spreadsheet that summarizes responses, including a time stamp for when each respondent completed the form.\nAfter consultation with CASCs is complete, the SA-ARD must provide a memo to the file (template here) certifying that consultation occurred. (Note: for grants and cooperative agreements the ARD may instead certify consultation was done by checking the appropriate box and signing the New Award Checklist - FWS Form 3-2460). Include a copy of the spreadsheet of responses as part of the official award file.\nEnter all project information into ScienceBase as soon as possible, but within 30 days of the agreement being in place (required per September 2017 memo). Provide as much information about projects as possible and update regularly, including adding entries for products within 30 days of receipt. See the ScienceBase Guidance section below for further details.\n\n\n\nRequired and Recommended Practices\nAs denoted by “(required)” in the list below, only practices 2, 5, and 6 are required per policy; the others are recommended but are not required. Note: required actions are the same as those listed above in the Summary of Required Actions. Unless otherwise specified, the following applies to all science projects funded with SA applications monies (1410, 1420, and 1430).\n\nDetermine if the project is a research project or other science activity (required). Consider whether the project will result in a science product (e.g. survey, study, tool, assessment, publication, etc.).\n\n\nIf you decide that it IS NOT research or another type of other science activity, document your decision using this template and attach it to the official award file (required).\n\n\nIf you decide that it IS research or another type of science activity, proceed with the steps outlined below.\nConsider coordinating with other federal agencies prior to the project funding phase:\n\nYou may consult informally during project development, or, when appropriate, invite staff from CASCs and other federal programs to be peer reviewers.\nWhen invited and able, consider participating in the project development and selection phases for other agencies’ research programs.\n\nSearch ScienceBase.gov for potentially duplicative projects prior to funding (required):\n\nDocument your search of ScienceBase using the ScienceBase search template.\n\n\nDo multiple searches (i.e. varying search terms and criteria) as necessary.\nBe expansive in your search – use a variety of search terms and limit the scope only as necessary. You should not limit your search to CASC communities.\n\n\n\nInclude copies of ScienceBase search template and corresponding results (spreadsheet) in the financial award file.\n\n\nRepeat Practice 2 at https://catalog.data.gov and any other relevant federal databases. You can use the ScienceBase search template to document these searches, though note that some of the instructions on the template are specific to ScienceBase.\nInsert this language in NOFO: “Applicants must document literature searchers (e.g. academic literature, industry publication, ScienceBase, and Data.gov). Applicants should explain why their project is non-duplicative and how it will augment existing knowledge.”(required)\nConsult with CASCs once you have selected a project to fund, but prior to funding. Email Anna-Marie_York@fws.gov to obtain a link to a form to send to CASC directors (required).\n\nUse the results of ScienceBase searches, informal consultations, and/or serving on review panels to identify CASCs that have funded similar research. You may also consider any CASC in your project geography. Aim to be expansive.\nConsider sending the form to leadership from other federal agencies as well.\nUsing google forms will allow us to download a spreadsheet of time-stamped responses. Email Anna_Marie_York@fws.gov for a copy of the resulting spreadsheet.\nInclude a copy of the responses (spreadsheet) in the financial award file.\n\nAfter consultation with CASCs is complete, the SA-ARD must provide a memo to the file (template here) certifying that consultation occurred. (Note: for grants and cooperative agreements the ARD may instead certify consultation was done by checking the appropriate box and signing the New Award Checklist - FWS Form 3-2460). Include a copy of the spreadsheet of responses as part of the official award file.\nEnter all project information into ScienceBase as soon as possible, but within 30 days of the agreement being in place (required per September 2017 memo). Provide as much information about projects as possible and update regularly, including adding entries for products within 30 days of receipt. See the ScienceBase Guidance section below for further details.\n\n\n\nScienceBase Guidance\n\nEvery region has folders in ScienceBase to put basic information about the science projects you have funded since September 30, 2017; per policy this is required within 30 days of funding a project or receiving a product. Here is what’s required for each project/product:\n\nTitle\nPI/funding recipient’s[1] name and contact info,\nPI/Funding recipient’s organization,\nstart date,\nprojected end date,\nabstract,\naward ID,\nfunding sources and amounts.\n\nYou can use mdEditor to make the records if that is your preference, or do it directly in ScienceBase. Here is a video tutorial showing how to enter directly on ScienceBase.\nIf you have a science activity that more than one FWS region contributed funds to, but there was a “lead region” that actually administered a single financial award / contract, then that lead region should create and maintain a single record in ScienceBase for the project and its products. The project record should list the total amount of Service funds in the financial / award contract (i.e., all regions combined).\nIf you have a science activity with multiple financial awards / contracts, then each award / contract should have its own ScienceBase record (note: modifications ARE NOT considered new awards / contracts). Whichever region administered each financial award / contract should create and maintain project and product records in ScienceBase. Please include the ScienceBase URL(s) for the related projects in the abstract. Example language: “this project is part of a larger initiative; you can find related records here: URL 1, URL 2, …”).\nIf you need “editing” access to your region’s ScienceBase folder…email Jill (jillian_cohen@fws.gov).\nIf you want a little more detail about what the “ScienceBase” policy is…Start with slides from a presentation Jill gave to the Data Management Working Group August 2018.\nIf you want all the details about the non-duplication policies…This dashboard is your gateway.\nIf you read through the slides and other documents and still have questions, or just want to check to make sure you’re doing things right call or email Jill (jillian_cohen@fws.gov; 703.358.1764).\n\n[1] The memo itself uses the term “project leader” instead of PI/funding recipient."

    "section": "",
    "text": "File management in mdEditor involves consistent and proper handling and storage of mdEditor derived formats of metadata. These files are essential for long-term access to metadata beyond a single work session.\n\n\nmdEditor stores information on your local computer in your browser’slocalStorage cache (not the normal file cache). This means that if you use a different browser to access mdEditor, it will not show the metadata records from your original browser. It also means that clearing your browser’s cache generally will not delete your mdEditor records. However, depending on your browser’s settings, clearing your browser cache may still delete your mdEditor data (e.g., in Chrome, checking the “c_ookies and other site data_” option will clear your mdEditor data).\n{% hint style=“danger” %} Warning: In mdEditor settings, you can clear your storage cache. Doing so will remove all of the information currently loaded in mdEditor. Reasons you might want to clear your storage cache is due to too much information stored in the cache, or as a way to debug a problem with mdEditor. It is very important that you back up your records before clearing the mdEditor cache to avoid losing your data. Consult the Export or Settings section of this manual to learn more. {% endhint %}\n\n\n\nThe underlying format of the metadata from mdEditor is mdJSON, which was created specifically for mdEditor. There are two types of mdJSON files.\n\nmdJSON files are the format that is published from mdEditor and made available on ScienceBase and data.gov. Their default file name is md_metadata.json.\nmdEditor.json files are the files used by mdEditor. They contain extra information, such as settings, that tell mdEditor how to operate. Their default file name is mdeditor-timestamp.json.\n\nmdJSON files can be exported and imported via mdEditor’s built-in Exportand Import functionality. The Export functionality allows you to back up and share your records between browsers. The Import functionality lets you load records into mdEditor, either from previously-saved mdEditor session, exported from another browser, or downloaded from ScienceBase.\n{% hint style=“info” %} JSON = JavaScript Object Notation, an open source file format. mdEditor produces mdJSON. ScienceBase has their own specific format, called sbJSON. {% endhint %}\n\n\n\n\n\nTo keep file size manageable, it is recommended that you work on one project (and its related products and contacts) at a time. You should group said project, products, and contacts together using the same scheme that your LCC uses to organize data.\n\nSave each project and affiliated products together as a set. To do this, select “Export” from the top menu, then select the appropriate records (i.e., the target project and its affiliated products) and then click “Export Selected.”\nSave the resulting mdEditor JSON file to your hard drive in a working folder. There should be a separate mdEditor JSON file for each project and all of its products.\n\n\n\n\nIt is recommended that you leave your contacts in mdEditor between work sessions so that they will be available the next time you need to create metadata records. You can also export your contacts independently of your records for use between browsers.\nYou can also set up a metadata directory so you can always find the metadata file. This directory can be any folder on your local computer that is easily accessible and will not be deleted.\n\n\n\nWhen exporting products or projects, you should also export your entire contact list. If you do not export your contact list, and you later import a record that contains a contact not loaded in mdEditor, you may receive an error and have to re-create and re-enter the contact for that record.\n{% hint style=“danger” %} If contacts records are re-created, it results in another mdEditor identifier being created for a contact, resulting in duplicate contacts. mdEditor does not know that this is an existing contact. You should maintain a single list of your contacts. Having duplicate copies of the same contact is not desirable. It can create confusion as you edit and manage your metadata records and introduce unnecessary errors. {% endhint %}\n\n\n\nMaintain an “Export All” JSON file each time you finish a work session in mdEditor (or switch browsers, URLs, etc.). This is the most efficient way to backup your records. For more information, consult Export.\nIt is particularly important that you export your records for backup before using mdEditor’s Clear Storage Cache functionality (clearing the storage cache will delete any records or data you have entered in mdEditor). Exporting ensures that your data is secure even after clearing the storage cache. Not exporting your data before clearing your cache will result in a permanent loss of records. Consult the Settings section of this manual to learn more."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)\nA Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a globally unique, persistent, and resolvable identifier used to uniquely identify objects and are widely used to identify academic, professional, and government information (e.g., journal articles, research reports, data sets, official publications). Think of it as a Social Security Number for your data. DOIs are standardized by the International Organization of Standards (ISO). DOIs are connected to the asset in perpetuity through a DOI hosting service (e.g., DataCite or CrossRef) that maintains the link to the resource.\nDOIs should be assigned to Service-funded assets such as dataset, services, models, and reports, with the exception of research publications where journals assign the DOIs. Using DOIs promotes discovery and re-useability of the Service’s work and investments in data and ensures appropriate recognition for those collecting and properly managing data assets.\nFor more information on DOIs, see Digital Object Identifier Handbook.\nThe Service Digital Object Identifier Management Tool enables Service personnel to assign DOIs, registered with DataCite, to Service-funded data products and other resources. This tool is used to mint (create), update, publish, administer, and search for Service DOIs. DOI required metadata includes the asset title, creator(s), publication date, type of data product, abstract, dates relevant to the resource, and an online link to the permanent repository location of resource and can be updated at any time.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Anatomy of a DOI URL\n\n\nFigure 1 from Alaska Region Interim Data Management User Guide\nOnce minted, the DOI is included as an identifier in your metadata record (Figure 2)\n\nThis Tool was developed and is managed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Science Analytics and Synthesis (SAS) Science Data Management Branch, under an interagency agreement with the Service.\nDOIs generated by this tool should be assigned to Service-funded data products (such as data releases, services, models, and reports), with the exception of primary research publications published in one of the Service’s journals which are assigned through a process governed by the National Conservation Training Center. To generate data product DOIs, you need to submit brief citation metadata, including the title, creator(s), publication date, type of data product, abstract, dates relevant to the data, and an online link to the data. These citation metadata can be updated at any time.\nBefore you being, collect required metadata information as follows:\n\n\n\nMetadata\nRequired?\n\n\n\n\nTitle\nRequired\n\n\nResource Type\nRequired\n\n\nPoint of Contact\nRequired\n\n\nDate\nRequired\n\n\nAbstract\nRequired\n\n\nRepository URL\nRequired\n\n\n\n\nCreating and maintaining a DOI\nThe DOI Tool is designed to be user friendly and guide you through the process to mint, populate metadata, publish, and administer DOIs. It is important to note that there is both a “beta” and “live” version of the DOI. The beta version is useful as a training resource to become familiar with the DOI Tool.. The live version is where you go to actually create a DOI, which can be set to hidden or public. DOIs assigned through the live version have a prefix of 10.7944.\nTo login to the DOI Tool:\n\nUse your Service email address and password. Once logged in, you will have “read-only” access to any record, “write” access to records that you created and to those where you have been added as a “Manager”.\n\n\nMinting a DOI\nMinting a DOI creates and reserves a DOI and DOI URL and does NOT require fully populated metadata fields. The benefit to minting the DOI early, such as in the Planning or Access Phase of the data lifecycle is efficiency. The DOI can be referencing in related documentation, metadata, and other elements of the project, reducing the need for updating later.\nTo mint a DOI, follow these steps:\n\nEnter our existing metadata into the DOI Tool following the instructions provided on the site. New users are encouraged to review the “NEW USER?” section in the login page (Figure 1). The DOI does not need to be published publicly until the DOI metadata is completed.\n\n\n\n\nNew User Instructions on the Login Page\n\n\nThe DOI is comprised of the resolvable service url, the registered prefix and a product identifier suffix (Figure 2). Service DOI are assigned the prefix of 10.7964. The DOI URL can be used as a weblink to the registered asset.\n\nOnce created, the DOI is ready for use asset related metadata, reports, publications, and other elements that need to refer to DOIs as soon as necessary.\nDuring the maintain phase of the data lifecycle, any empty fields in the DOI metadata should be updated.\nOnce the fields in the DOI metadata are fully populated, publish the DOI. This creates the digital tether to the URL for the data resource landing page.\nYou can administer the DOI at any time using the DOI tools dashboard(s). See the DOI Administration section below for more information.\nInclude the DOI as an identifier in your metadata record (Figure 2b). As an identifier, only the prefix and suffix are needed.\nInclude the DOI as an online resource in your metadata record (Figure 2c). In this case the entire DOI url is needed.\n\n\n\n\nINCORRECT DOI entry as identifier in metadata\n\n\n\n\n\nCORRECT DOI entry as identifier in metadata\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of DOI entered as both online resource and identifier\n\n\n\n\n\nDOI Administration\nThe Service has secured a large, yet limited bank (range) of DOIs. Once minted, the DOI is valid in perpetuity. If you are new to the DOI, please get familiar with the tool in the training beta version. When ready to officially reserve a DOI, use the live version of the tool. The DOI tool was not intended to be used do not for data assets that were not initiated, funded, or delivered as part of a Service project.\nTo date the Service has not identified a responsible party or governance for administering DOIs within the Service. As a result, the duties of DOI administration must fall to the collective of Service DOI creators/editors. DOI administration duties include:\nEnsuring minted DOIs are being used for their intended purpose, which includes:\n\nMinimizing the number of DOIs being minted and never published,\n\nEnsuring one DOI per digital object (e.g. research reports, data sets, service, etc.)\nEnsuring URL paths are still resolvable (no broken web links attached to the DOI)\n\nProviding usage reports\nHelping to reconcile previous DOIs from other DOI services\nEnhancing supplemental DOI metadata\n\nEach Service program, currently without enterprise level governance, has the option to administer the assignment of DOIs to their data assets within their program such that it meets their workflow. While the tool is available for any Service employee to login and create a DOI, a program may prefer to have a process to trigger a review or notification before a DOI is created. For example, an employee may login and create a DOI during planning set the DOI to hidden until the data and set edit rights to other accountable data staff. Once completed and approved, the DOI status can be set to public.\n\n\n\nExample of DOI Tool Dashboard\n\n\n\n\nBulk DOI Creation and Updates API\nThis tool also has an optional Web API (application programming interface) component for the automated creation and editing of DOIs and may be useful for bulk creation of DOIs through scripting/programming. After logging into the tool with your Department of Interior Active Directory credentials, see the DOI API link for more information.\n\n\n\nDOI API tool link indicated with red arrow"

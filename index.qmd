## Introduction

This manual describes the requirements and best practices for the creation of 
high-quality and consistent metadata records for projects and products for 
USFWS Science Applications. These metadata requirements conform to the 
standardized metadata format agreed upon by the SA Data Management Working Group 
and meets USFWS policy requirements for data management. This metadata drives 
the unified SA Science Catalog, where SA projects and products are discoverable, 
accessible, and usable.

If you have questions/concerns regarding this guidance, please contact the 
FWS SA National Data Steward (sadatasteward@fws.gov) or 
Blake Massey (blake_massey@fws.gov).

## USFWS Data Management Integration

Metadata creation is part of the Maintain step of the [Data Management Lifecycle](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/sites/fws-data/SitePages/Data_management_life_cycle_home.aspx).
Guidance is also available in the [USFWS Data Management Handbook.](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/sites/fws-data/Shared%20Documents/References/DataManagementHandbook.pdf?web=1)

### Metadata and mdEditor

The metadata editing tool employed to create and support metadata requirements 
is mdEditor. This tool was an extension of an initiative by the 
[Alaska Data Integration Working Group](http://www.adiwg.org/about/) 
([ADIwg](content/glossary.qmd#adiwg)) 
and adopted by SA.

This manual refers to the creation of SA metadata specifically. If you want 
information on the creation of other metadata records using mdEditor, or more 
information in general, please refer to the 
[mdEditor User Manual](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/).

## Who Should Use this Manual

This guide is for anyone creating or updating metadata for SA-related projects 
and products. The primary purpose is to describe in detail how to develop 
metadata for items for inclusion in the SA Science Catalog, but the tool can 
also be used to track any project or funding.

The metadata requirements described here apply to science projects and products 
that were funded by SA (for more details, see the 
[Project, Products, and Contacts](content/projects_products_contacts.qmd) section).

## How to Use this Manual

Directly accessing this manual from the internet is the recommended way to use 
this manual. By doing so, you will guarantee that you are using the current
version since it is a live document and any updates can be made instantly. The 
online version will also have the best functionality and graphical display.

If needed, you can download this manual as a PDF and save a copy to your 
computer for printing or offline use. If you choose this method, be sure to 
reference the online version regularly and save a new PDF as updates are made 
to the online version. Also note that not all of the formatting will be exactly 
the same as the online version.

:::{.callout-note}
Some of the stylized text boxes \(like this one\) will not translate to the PDF 
exactly. The text will still be outlined with a background color, but the icon 
above the text will not display in the PDF.

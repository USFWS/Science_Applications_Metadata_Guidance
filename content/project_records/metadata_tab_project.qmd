The **Metadata** tab describes your project's metadata, including a description 
that outlines the process of metadata creation, contributors to the creation of 
the metadata, and metadata repositories.

## Basic Information

### Metadata Status [(Required)]`r req_style`

Select the appropriate **Status** of the creation of your metadata from the drop
down menu. For example, if you have added all of your metadata, select
***completed***. If you still have metadata to add, select ***onGoing***.

### Dates [(Required)]`r req_style`

At least one **Date** is required. Recommended are ***creation*** (when you 
first created your metadata) and ***lastUpdate*** (when you updated metadata 
after initial publication).

## Metadata Contacts

### **Contacts** [(Required)]`r req_style` 
These **Contacts** (person or role) will provide a point of contact for 
users to reach out to should they have any questions about the 
metadata. The following table shows the required contact roles. 

| Role           | Contact         | Requirements              |
|:---------------|:-----------------|:-------------------------|
| **author**         | See Notes Below  | [Required]`r req_style`   |
| **publisher**      | Default is USFWS | [Required]`r req_style`   |
| **pointOfContact** | SA Data Steward  | [Required]`r req_style`   |
: {.striped .hover .bordered .md .allborder} 


#### Metadata Contact Notes:

-   The author should be an individual and can be a generic data manager.
-   In most cases, the author will be the data manager, but could be anyone,
    including someone outside of FWS (e.g., imported FGDC metadata can list the
    original author).
-   Publisher can also include the FWS Region and/or Program.
-   The point of contact should be a Regional or National Data Steward.

## Metadata Identifier

### Metadata Identifier [(Required)]`r req_style` 

The **Identifier** is automatically populated by mdEditor. The metadata
identifier gives each of your projects and products a unique ID and
differentiates them from other similar projects and products. Digital Object
Identifiers are not needed for Projects.

-   If the record was imported from ScienceBase, the Metadata Identifier will be
    auto-populated with the ScienceBase ID (SBID).
-   If the record was created in mdEditor, it will generate a universally unique
    identifier (UUID).

![mdEditor Metadata auto-generated identifier entry](../../assets/metadata_auto_generated_identifier.png)

:::{.callout-warning}
Once a Metadata Identifier is created in the metadata,
do not change it. mdEditor uses the Metadata Identifier to connect records and
changing the Metadata Identifier can break those connections. If there are
additional identifiers you want to include in your metadata record, include them
in the [Citation Identifier](main_tab_project.qmd#identifier). 
:::

## Parent Metadata [(Required)]`r req_style`

**Parent Metadata** tells mdEditor where the project metadata should go when it
is published. If using ScienceBase, this is the folder above the project by
default.

If you imported the project metadata from ScienceBase originally, this section
will be populated already.

If you created the project metadata from scratch in mdEditor, this will be
blank. If you provide a default parent ID in
[Settings](../settings.qmd#publishing-settings) (Publishing Settings for
ScienceBase), this will be generated for you when when you publish. This is most
likely your SA regional project folder. You can enter the parent item SBID
directly in your individual metadata record if you wish.

### Title [(Required)]`r req_style` 

If the **Title** is not already populated, you can enter something like 
"Parent Folder".

### Identifier and Namespace [(Required)]`r req_style`

The **Identifier** and **Namespace** defines the location of the parent folder 
in ScienceBase.

:::{.callout-info}
The ScienceBase identifier is the alphanumeric string in
the item's URL immediately following "**item/".** For example,
**66326aebd34ea70bd5f26d62** is the SBID for the item at the URL:
<https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/66326aebd34ea70bd5f26d62>

## Metadata Repositories

### Repositories [(Required)]`r req_style`
The metadata **Repositories** indicate where the metadata will be sent upon 
publishing.

For projects that should be listed in the **SA Science Catalog**: 

- Select ”**ScienceCatalog**” from the repository list. ”**SA Science Catalog**” 
should automatically show up as the collection title. 
- If the **Collection Title** does not appear, stop and enter the correct 
information in [Settings](../settings.qmd). Then select the repository for your 
project. 

Projects without the correct **Repository** and **Collection Title** will not 
show up in the SA Science Catalog.

![Example SA Science Catalog Metadata entry](../../assets/example_sa_science_catalog_metadata.png)

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
The **Repository** and **Collection Title** must be exactly the same for each 
of your records with no variations in spelling, spaces, capitalization, etc. 
Specifying this information in [Settings](../settings.qmd#publishing-settings) 
is the best way to ensure the repository information will be consistent across 
all of your records. It strongly recommended that you avoid typing these in by 
hand on individual metadata records. 
:::

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
You should only use the Data.gov repository for data
products such as datasets, GIS data, etc. Data.gov does not include reports,
presentations, or other documents nor are projects sent to data.gov.

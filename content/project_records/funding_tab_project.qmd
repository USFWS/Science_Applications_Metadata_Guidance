Tracking funding in the metadata allows for identification of funding sources
and recipients, enables comparisons, and aggregations across all regions.

## Funding Allocations

Allocations describe where project funding came from, how much, where and when
it was distributed. Science Catalog users can search by specific fiscal year,
funders, or recipients.

A funding allocation represents a single fiscal year, source, and recipient.

::: callout-note
If you have two recipients in a single fiscal year, each needs to be added as
separate funding allocations.
:::

### Required Fields

For each funding allocation, the following fields should be filled out.

#### Award ID (Required)

The Award ID numbers are internal codes that connect the distribution forms to
the project metadata. Award IDs include grant or cooperative agreement numbers,
contract numbers, or inter-agency agreement numbers. Inclusion of Award IDs
provides accountability and allows tracking and auditing between financial
systems and the Science Catalog.

If no Award ID exists, then the project is likely an internal effort. Enter
'*None*" in the Award ID field. This allows for tracking and search of
internally funded projects.

#### Amount (Required)

Enter the amount of funding. Be sure U.S. Dollars is selected (ie. Unites States
of America, the--US Dollar; this is third from the bottom of USD options in
mdEditor).

#### Source (Required)

Add the relevant contact for the “source” of the project funding. Source should
be an organization, not an individual. For SA projects, the most common sources
are U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, and Bureau of
Reclamation.

::: {.callout-note}
Funding source should always identify the agency or organization, rather than a
sub-program or office. For example, all funding from other FWS programs need to
list U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as the source (and not list the source as
Fisheries, specific Refuges, ES, etc.). Clarifications on the exact program or
office where the funding came from should be done through the Funding/Other
Contacts field.
:::

#### Recipient (Required)

Add the relevant contact for the “recipient” of the project funding. Recipient
should always be an organization, not an individual. For example, the Principal
Investigator would not be listed as the recipient, but their organization would
be. If there are multiple recipients for a project, they need to be added as
separate allocations.

You could add the Principal Investigator in the Other Contacts field as
"principalInvestigator."

#### Other Contacts (Required)

In most cases, a program or region has allocated the funding for a project. In
order to track funds within regions and programs and provide proper credit, add
the FWS region (yes, both the legacy region and the DOI unified region for now)
as the funding "administrator" for all allocations. Recall that the funding
source should identify the agency who supplied the funding (i.e. US Fish and
Wildlife Service). Also, add the program name, if applicable, as the funding
"administrator".

::: {.callout-note}
Funding administrator can also be used to differentiate funding from different
programs/offices within the same agency. For example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service can be identified as the funding source and the funding administrator
may also include "Ecological Services" or a specific field office.
:::

#### Marked Funding

In some cases, funds are marked for specific activities and include reporting
requirements that accompany the funding allocations. For example, EPA allocates
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) funds on behalf of Congress to FWS,
among others. FWS then distributes the funds across programs for use. The Gulf
Coast Restore funds are a similar case. This funding flow can be tracked and
aggregated with the Funding Other Contacts. Add the Name of the funding source
as an organization contact and add the funding source as the "*funder*" in
Funding Other Contacts.

#### FWS sub-activity, funding codes, agreement type (Best Practice)

In order to better integrate budgeting records and align with activity tracking
priorities, add the FWS sub-activity code and funding code in the Allocation
comments. Also add the funding For example, the text entry may look like this:
FWS sub-activity 1420, fundcode 190, contract. If funds are provided from
multiple sub-activities, please add this in the description (i.e. FWS
sub-activity 1430, fundcode 170, \$30,000: sub-activity 1420, fundcode 170,
\$10,000). At some point in the future, mdEditor may include additional fields
for these values.

#### Matching and In-kind Funds

Project funds or in-kind support that were supplied by a partner (i.e., not
specifically allocated to SA) should be included as an allocation as described
above, but with the matching fund box checked. Each matching fund provider needs
to be included as a separate allocation.

![Example of Matching Allocation Metadata entry](../../assets/example_matching_allocation.png)

## Time Period

### Dates (Required)

For each allocation, enter the fiscal year that funds were awarded (not the time
span of the entire project). There should be a single fiscal year for each
allocation. Adding a time period lets users know when your items were funded,
and lets them find your item when searching for items funded in a similar time
period.

::: callout-note
Use the “Pick a Fiscal Year” dropdown to autofill the date fields.

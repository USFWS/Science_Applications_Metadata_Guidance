The **Associated** section is used to connect metadata records with each other.
This feature should be used when items are related, for example, products are
often the result of projects, and projects often have sub-projects. Projects and
Products can be linked together by using association. Adding associations gives
users the ability to find items that relate to each other in the Science
Catalog.

:::{.callout-note icon=false} 
In ScienceBase, **Associated Records** are referred to as **Item Associations**.
:::

:::{.callout-note icon=false title="Reminder"} 
Project-product associations are different than parent-child
relationships on ScienceBase.

## Create Associations

In mdEditor, associations can be created from the Project record or the Product
record. The **Association Type** will define the association from your current
record to the linked record. Specifying the **Linked Association Type** will
create the association from the other direction.

:::{.callout-note icon=false title="Important"} 
It is recommended you ***always*** specify the
**Linked Association Type** when you create associations. This will ensure the
associations are defined from both directions and be present in the metadata no
matter how the metadata is translated or where it is used in the future. 
:::

If you import records from ScienceBase, the record associations might be
automatically created, but sometimes associations may need to be created
manually (as described below). Associations can only be made after both project
and product records have been created or imported into mdEditor.

#### Quick Reference: Creating an Association in a Project Record     
1. Select **product** from the Association Type drop-down menu.       
2. Use the **Select a Record** button to select an associated product.
3. Choose the product that you would like to associate from the **Select a Resource** list.  
4. Fill out the Linked Association Type with **parentProject**.

### Steps for Creating an Association in a Project Record

1. Select **product** from the **Association Type** drop-down menu.
This field will describe the relationship from the associated record to the
project record (the associated record is the product of the project record you
are editing).

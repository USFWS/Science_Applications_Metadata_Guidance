## Basic Information

### Record ID [(Required)]`r required_style`

The **Record ID** will be auto-generated. It can be edited but it should only be
edited if absolutely necessary (and ideally edited as soon as the record is
created in mdEditor).

### Title [(Required)]`r required_style`

Enter a concise, yet informative **Title**. Good titles, when they appear in a
search, will be understood and traceable.

### Status [(Required)]`r required_style`

The **Status** drop-down menu allows you to select the status of your project.
Choose a status from <u>only these four</u> options: ***accepted***, 
***completed***, ***onGoing***, or ***proposed***.

## Default Locale [(Required)]`r required_style`

**Default Locale** allows for the selection of **Language**, **Character Set**,
and **Country**. English, UTF-8, and USA will be selected by default, but you
may change them if necessary. See [Settings](../settings.qmd) for instruction.

![](../../assets/default_locale.png)

## Resource Types [(Required)]`r required_style`

For projects, the **Resource Type** should be automatically filled in with the
resource type you selected when you created your record. This should be
"project" for all SA projects. Name is optional - you can leave this blank or
enter a shorten project name.

## Points of Contacts [(Required)]`r required_style`

Adding a **Point of Contact** gives users information on who to contact should
they have a question regarding your project or product.

:::{.callout-note icon=false} 
To add contacts to a metadata record, you must first create/upload the contacts
into mdEditor. See the [Contact
Records](../contact_records/contact_records_overview.qmd) Section for more
information.

![Example Points of Contact Entry in
mdEditor](../../assets/example_points_of_contact.png)

:::{.callout-note icon=false}
The **FWS Science Applications National Data Steward** will serve as the long term
contact and backup. This way, users have a point-of-contact even if there is a
positional change within an organization. Regional Data Steward should be
included in addition as a point of contact, if available.
:::

## Citation

The **Citation** describes pertinent information about your project such as:
responsible parties, internal and ScienceBase identifiers, and any online
resources that may relate to your item. The citation, much like a peer-reviewed
publication citation, provides credit and services as a reference citation.
Adding information in the citation will also improve users' ability to find your
items.

### Title [(Required)]`r required_style`

The citation **Title** is automatically populated with the title of your record.

### Alternate Title 

You can add an **Alternate Title**, if desired. Generally these should be 
shorter than the full Title.

### Dates [(Required)]`r required_style`

Enter **Dates** for *acquisition*, *creation*, *updated*, or *revision* from the 
pick list and then enter the date. <u>At least one</u> of these date types is 
required.

### Responsible Parties [(Required)]`r required_style`

**Responsible parties** must include the principal investigator of the project, 
but may optionally include other responsible parties such as funders (your 
region and program), partners, collaborators, and contributors. Collaborators 
could be intellectual participants while contributors could be intellectual and 
financial participants.

::: callout-note
To add contacts to a metadata record, you must first create/upload the contacts
in mdEditor. See the [Contacts](../contact_records/contact_records_overview.qmd)
section for more information.

### Online Resource

Enter the **Name** and **URL** for the project homepage website, if available.

### Identifier [(Required)]`r required_style`

You may enter as many **Identifiers** as desired. The identifier for the 
repository is required here. If you have other internal IDs for projects, enter 
them here. Other optional identifiers for projects include: 
[Archive](../archiving.qmd) Folder Name.

::: {.callout-note title="Best Practice"}
Create and use internal identifiers that are unique within your region or
program for projects and their products. Example: GNLCC2010-11.
:::

::: callout-note
If your item does not have a ScienceBase ID yet, ScienceBase will create one
automatically upon publishing. If you imported your item from ScienceBase
originally, then the SBID will already be included in Metadata/Metadata
Identifier and you do not need to include it here. Note that if you edit an item
that is already on ScienceBase without using its existing ID, a duplicate item
will be created on ScienceBase. Consult the
[Publish](../publishing/publishing_overview.qmd) section of this manual to learn
more.

## Description

### Abstract [(Required)]`r required_style`

Enter an **Abstract** that succinctly describes the project's purpose and goals.
Include key species or habitats as well.

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
Write your project abstract in the present tense if the project is in
progress and past tense if the project has been completed.
:::

### Short Abstract

For the **Short Abstract** enter a short description, limited to 300 characters, 
if desired. By default, mdEditor will fill the short abstract with the first 300 
characters of the Abstract. Best practice is to write this abstract for public 
outreach, such as use by Office of Communications.

### Purpose

The **Purpose** should be a short narrative about the issue or problem that the 
resource is designed to address and anticipated results or benefits. 

### Supplemental Information

For the **Supplemental Information** enter comments, if desired.

![Example Abstract entry in mdEditor](../../assets/example_abstract_entry.png)

## Time Period 

### Dates [(Required)]`r required_style`

For each project, add a **Start Date** and **End Date**. If the project 
spanned a single fiscal year, you can use the “Pick a Fiscal Year” drop-down to 
autofill the date fields.

::: callout-note
This set of dates is distinct from the fiscal year of funding. Here you want to
indicate the overall project start and end dates. In the Funding section you
will specify the fiscal years that funds were allocated.

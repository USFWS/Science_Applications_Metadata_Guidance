### Harvest Set Tag

The SB Scanner will show all of the Harvest Set tags you have in ScienceBase
(called Metadata Repositories in mdEditor). The following warnings may be shown:

| Harvest Set Tag Warning                                         | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|:---------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------|
| not valid LCC repository tag                                    | Your Science Catalog tag is something other than "LCC Network Science Catalog" and needs to be fixed. See [QA/QC Fixes](./#metadata) for more info.                                                              |
| Warning: too many variants of data.gov tag. pick one and use it | You have more than one version of a data.gov tag (you must use only one version). See [data.gov Metadata Repository tag](../../product-entry-guidance/metadata-tab-product/#metadata-repositories) for guidance. |

### Warnings

The ScienceBase Scanner will produce the following warnings. These are not
necessarily errors, particularly if you have items on ScienceBase that are not
intended for inclusion in the Science Catalog and therefore do not follow the
metadata requirements. These warnings will allow you to check your SB records to
ensure you have met metadata requirements and make necessary updates and
corrections.

Note: if you see a warning in the SB Scanner that isn't listed here, please let
Megan Cook (megan_cook\@fws.gov) know to add to this list.

| Warning Type                                        | Definition                                                                                                                                     |

| ResourceType should be more specific than 'product' | Products in the Science Catalog need a specific Resource Type identified, not the generic "product."                                           |
| no ISO topic                                        | There is no ISO Topic Keyword selected (for a project or product).                                                                             |

### Summary View

The summary view shows:

-   All "Project" type items under their LCC community, grouped by the path on
    ScienceBase. Projects are shown in green.
-   All items of any kind below that Project item. Products are light blue and
    other items are red/pink.
-   The pink/red items could be:
    -   Intended Projects which are not marked as such yet
    -   Products which are not yet linked from their Project
    -   Organizational Folders beneath a project
-   Any other products that are NOT located below the Project
-   For each item, it will list the number of weblinks, and the number and type
    of file attachments.

A "\[D\]" added to the end of the title means that the item is marked as "Data,"
and a "\[P\]" means marked as a "Publication."

Note: Project items are those directly marked as such in ScienceBase via the
browseType. Products are found via links from those Projects (i.e., a "Product"
is an item linked from the Project as an Associated Item of "Produced" type).

### Rescanning

Querying ScienceBase for all the items in a given Community is slow, so the SB
scanner makes local copies of the query results, and drives the display of this
tool from those local copies. You can see the time of the last scan for each
community on the top page and on each community page.

If you have made changes in ScienceBase since then, you can requery ScienceBase
using the "rescan" link at the end of the status line on the individual
community pages (choose Summary on the top page, then read the top lines of the
display).

#### Missing Keywords You Know Are Entered

There may be instances where you have added keywords for ISO Topic Category, LCC
Project Category, LCC Deliverable Type, or LCC End User Type but the ScienceBase
scanner is showing them as missing. This may have been an issue introduced for
LCCs who used the template scripting (i.e., input metadata into a spreadsheet
that Josh scripted into mdEditor to create your initial metadata records). Below
is a possible way to check and solve that issue.

\(1\) If you go into the Keywords section of your record, you may see that there
are entries under "Selected Keywords" but those selections aren't highlighted
green in the tree of options.\
![](../../.gitbook/assets/error_missing_keywords_nogreen.png)

\(2\) Click on the desired options in the tree, which will add a duplicate set
of those keywords in "Selected Keywords."
![](../../.gitbook/assets/error_missing_keywords_add.PNG)

\(3\) Delete the duplicate keywords **from the top of the list**.
![](../../.gitbook/assets/error_missing_keywords_delete.PNG)

\(4\) Now your keywords should be selected properly. You can re-publish and
check the SB scanner again.

## Automatic QA/QC Checks from DJ Case

[Link to Automatic QA/QC List from DJ
Case](https://lccnetwork.org/science-catalog/api/item/qaqcIssues)

To aid in our metadata improvements, DJ Case created an automated QA/QC system
of checks. This is a dynamic list of errors that will update when you fix an
error and republish your record. Note that the updates will only when the
Science Catalog itself updates, which occurs overnight.

Below are definitions of each issue described in the list:

| Warning Type                                                                                                   | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

This is required.                                                                                                                |

| A responsible party has an invalid role ([valid roles](https://mdtools.adiwg.org/#codes-page?c=iso_role))      | Invalid roles are likely leftover from items originally created on ScienceBase and then imported into mdEditor.

| An invalid resource type has been specified ([valid types](https://mdtools.adiwg.org/#codes-page?c=iso_scope)) | Invalid resource types are likely leftover from items originally created on ScienceBase and then imported into mdEditor. You may not be able to see the erroneous resource type unless you are in "View" mode for the mdEditor record, rather than in "Edit" mode. |
| Duplicate contact name                                                                                         | There are multiple unique Contact IDs in the mdJSON for the same "Contact Name."                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Manual QA/QC Checks

[Link to Manual QA/QC
List](https://github.com/docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eUeDjCFpLIiVksmkmzL7-BoBr8ai8rl09FBDIh7Xe3w/edit?usp=sharing/README.md)

### Contacts Errors

[Link to Contacts QA/QC
List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eUeDjCFpLIiVksmkmzL7-BoBr8ai8rl09FBDIh7Xe3w/edit#gid=0)

DJ Case identified a list of errors in the Contacts during the initial creation
of the Science Catalog. This is a static list of errors (i.e., it will not
update when you fix an issue listed). The list contains a description of the
contact error and the SBIDs for the records that contain that item.

Please update the "Fixed" column to "yes" when you have addressed a particular
item.

### Science Catalog Errors from Manual QA/QC from ASG

[Link to Manual QA/QC List from
ASG](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eUeDjCFpLIiVksmkmzL7-BoBr8ai8rl09FBDIh7Xe3w/edit#gid=117396702)

This is a list of errors in the Science Catalog, as identified through manual
QA/QC checks by the ASG. This is a living list that will be added to as other
errors are identified.

Keyword typos are based on the records in the Science Catalog as of 10/22/18.

Once you have corrected the issue, please update the "Status" column to "Fixed."

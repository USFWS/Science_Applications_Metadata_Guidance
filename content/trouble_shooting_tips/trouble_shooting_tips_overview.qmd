## Records fail to update to the SA Science Catalog:

Occasionally, an item may seem to publish correctly to ScienceBase when if fact,
the mdJSON did not publish. ScienceBase items without mdJSON file attachements
are not in the Science Catalog nor will the automated QA/QC checks identify
issues with those records. It is strongly recommended that you check the
[ScienceBase scanner](http://calcommons.info/sb2/scansb.php) for any SB records
that are missing mdJSON and re-publish those records before proceeding through
metadata improvements. Remember that newly-published mdJSON will not be
reflected in the Science Catalog until the following day (it updates daily
overnight).

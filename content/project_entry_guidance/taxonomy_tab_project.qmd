Taxonomy is required for projects and strongly recommended for products (where
applicable).

## Taxonomy

mdEditor's new “Taxonomy” section automatically pulls in taxonomic information
from ITIS (Integrated Taxonomic Information System – see itis.gov for more
information).

:::{.callout-info} 
Please note that this functionality in mdEditor is not
intended to explore ITIS. It is a tool to add known taxonomic information to
your metadata. If you want to explore ITIS, go to itis.gov to find information
and then come back to mdEditor with the desired search values.
:::

The minimum requirements for valid taxonomy are a Taxonomic System plus one or
more taxonomic classifications.

### Add Taxonomic System

\(1\) Click "Add Collection"

![](../../assets/taxonomy_add_collection.png)

\(2\) From here, you can click "Add Taxa from ITIS" directly (on right side)
without adding the taxonomic system. This will be filled in for you
automatically once you have added items from ITIS.

![](../../assets/taxonomy_add_taxa_from_itis.png)

\(3\) Enter your search terms in the search box. You can type in a common name,
scientific name, or TSN (Taxonomic Serial Number, assigned by ITIS). You can
type in any level of taxonomy, not just species name (e.g., you can type in an
order or class or genus). You can specify by Kingdom if you like.

:::{.callout-note} 
If you haven’t used the search in a while (or ever) the
ITIS service might be asleep so it will take a few more seconds to load but then
will load quickly after that. 
:::

:::{.callout-note} 
The status of the taxonomic classification is denoted in
() after the TSN. ITIS may consider a classification "invalid" if the species
was reclassified, for example. It is up to you whether you want to add invalid
ITIS classifications to your metadata.

\(4\) Click "Add" for the search results you want to add to your record and then
click "Import Taxa." You will get a message of successful import at the bottom
of your screen.

:::{.callout-note} 
You don't need to worry about clicking import multiple
times for the same species. mdEditor is smart enough to know not to create
duplicate entries of the same species.
:::

![](../../assets/taxonomy_successful_import.png)

\(5\) Click "Back to Collection." You will see that it has added a taxonomic
hierarchy. It has also added a Title to Taxonomic System (if you hadn’t already
added one by hand). This complete the the minimum information required for
taxonomy.

:::{.callout-note} 
You can click on any level of the taxonomic hierarchy to collapse the entries 
below that level.
:::

:::{.callout-note} 
mdEditor only adds common names at the lowest taxonomic level you identified 
(e.g., species level). 
:::

![](../../assets/taxonomy_collection.png)

\(6\) You can add additional information regarding the taxonomic information if
you desire.

**Observers** would be filled out when there were people who actually went in
the field/lab and identified species. Here you would lie the people who did that
work.

-   General Scope: You can add a description of the range of taxa addressed in
    the dataset or collection.
-   Identification Procedure: You can describe the methods used for taxonomic
    identification.
-   Identification Completeness: You can add information regarding completeness
    and uncertainty in the identifications.

**Voucher** is where you can add information about specimens you submitted to a
museum or a storage facility where you are storing specimens, can document that
here (select a Repository via a Contact entered in mdEditor).

## When Taxonomy is Needed

Taxonomy is mostly used for search is discovery and functions similar to
keywords.

:::{.callout-note}
If you have existing species names or other keywords,
you do not need to delete those. Taxonomy is entered in a separate section in
mdJSON so they are separate from Keywords. 
:::

To some extent, this is up to the judgement of the data manager. You will know
best the connection of a resource to a specific species or other taxonomic
group. For example, if a bear model was used to rank habitat for a
prioritization product but the final output is not relevant to bears any longer,
then you probably wouldn't want to add bear species in taxonomy.

## Reporting Issues

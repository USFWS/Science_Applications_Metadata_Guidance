The Metadata tab describes your project's metadata, including a description that
outlines the process of metadata creation, contributors to the creation of the
metadata, and metadata repositories.

| Quick Reference: Project Metadata Tab     | Required? |
|:------------------------------------------|:----------|
| Basic Information: Metadata Status, Dates | Required  |
| Metadata Contacts                         | Required  |
| Metadata Identifier                       | Required  |
| Parent Metadata                           | Required  |
| Metadata Repositories                     | Required  |

## Basic Information

### Metadata Status

Select the appropriate status of the creation of your metadata from the drop
down menu. For example, if you have added all of your metadata, select
*"completed"*. If you still have metadata to add, select *"onGoing"*.

### Dates

Add at least one date is required. Recommended are "creation" (when you first
created your metadata) and "lastUpdate" (when you updated metadata after initial
publication).

## Metadata Contacts

**Metadata Contacts** are required. Adding a metadata contact will give users a
contact point should they have any questions about the metadata. \_\_

| **Role**       | **Contact**      | **Required?**            |
|:---------------|:-----------------|:-------------------------|
| author         | See notes below  | At least one is required |
| publisher      | default is USFWS | Required                 |
| pointOfContact | SA Data Steward  | Required                 |

#### Metadata Contact Notes:

-   The author should be an individual and can be a generic data manager.
-   In most cases, the author will be the data manager, but could be anyone,
    including someone outside of FWS (e.g., imported FGDC metadata can list the
    original author).
-   Publisher can also include the FWS region and/or program.
-   The point of contact should be a regional or national data steward.

## Metadata Identifier

The **Metadata Identifier** is automatically populated by mdEditor. The metadata
identifier gives each of your projects and products a unique ID and
differentiates them from other similar projects and products. Digital Object
Identifiers are not needed for Projects.

-   If the record was imported from ScienceBase, the Metadata Identifier will be
    auto-populated with the ScienceBase ID (SBID).
-   If the record was created in mdEditor, it will generate a universally unique
    identifier (UUID).

:::{.callout-warning}
Once a Metadata Identifier is created in the metadata,
do not change it. mdEditor uses the Metadata Identifier to connect records and
changing the Metadata Identifier can break those connections. If there are
additional identifiers you want to include in your metadata record, include them
in [Main/Citation/Identifier](main_tab_project.qmd#identifier).

## Parent Metadata

**Parent Metadata** tells mdEditor where the project metadata should go when it
is published. If using ScienceBase, this is the folder above the project by
default.

If you imported the project metadata from ScienceBase originally, this section
will be populated already.

If you created the project metadata from scratch in mdEditor, this will be
blank. If you provide a default parent ID in
[Settings](../settings.qmd#publishing-settings) (Publishing Settings for
ScienceBase), this will be generated for you when when you publish. This is most
likely your SA regional project folder. You can enter the parent item SBID
directly in your individual metadata record if you wish.

### Parent Metadata Required Fields:

#### Title (Required)

If this is not already populated, you can enter something like "Parent folder."

#### Identifier and namespace (Required)

Defines the location of the parent folder in ScienceBase.

| Identifier                                 | Namespace   |
|:-------------------------------------------|:------------|
| ScienceBase identifier for the parent item | scienceBase |

:::{.callout-info}
The ScienceBase identifier is the alphanumeric string in
the item's URL immediately following "**item/".** For example,
**59b97600e4b091459a54d9f3c** is the SBID for the item at the URL:
<https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59b97600e4b091459a54d9f3c>

## Metadata Repositories

**Metadata Repositories** indicate where the metadata will be sent upon
publishing.

### SA Science Catalog

For projects that should be listed in the SA Science Catalog: Select
*“ScienceCatalog”* from the repository list. *“SA Science Catalog”* should
automatically show up as the collection title. If the collection title does not
appear, stop and enter the correct information in [Settings](../settings.qmd).
Then select the repository for your project. Projects without the correct tag
and collection title will not show up in the Science Catalog.

:::{.callout-danger}
The Metadata Repository and Collection Title must be
exactly the same for each of your records with no variations in spelling,
spaces, capitalization, etc. Specifying this information in Settings is the best
way to ensure the repository information will be consistent across all of your
records. It strongly recommended that you do not type these in by hand on
individual metadata records. 
:::

:::{.callout-info}
You should only use the data.gov repository for data
products such as datasets, GIS data, etc. Data.gov does not include reports,
presentations, or other documents nor are projects sent to data.gov.

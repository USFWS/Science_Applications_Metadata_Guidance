Adding keywords to your metadata record allows for the record to be found later
through a search engine, keywords are the way to tag your projects or products.
mdEditor is designed using existing thesauruses that contain pre-determined
keywords.

## Add Keywords to your Project

1.  Click “+ Add Thesaurus” on the right to add the different thesauruses.
2.  Add keywords from the following pre-populated thesauruses.
3.  If none of the keywords in the following categories are sufficient for
    tagging your project, you can add other keywords with a custom thesaurus
    (see below for more information).

## SA Project Required Keywords

### ISO Topic Category (Required)

Because mdJSON metadata is based on the ISO (International Organization for
Standardization) metadata standard, all LCC projects must select at least one
ISO Topic Category. ISO topics were generally meant for spatial data so they
might be a bit of a stretch, bu do your best to find the best fit. mdEditor
provides definitions of each ISO topic category if you hover over the ? icon.

Choose all that apply. The ISO Topic list is as follows:

1.  biota
2.  boundaries
3.  climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere
4.  economy
5.  elevation
6.  environment
7.  geoscientificInformation
8.  health
9.  imageryBaseMapsEarthCover
10. intelligenceMilitary
11. inlandWaters
12. location
13. oceans
14. planningCadastre
15. society
16. structure
17. transportation
18. utilitiesCommunication

:::{.callout-info} 
Tip: Biota and environment are probably the best fit for
most LCC projects.

### Conservation Action Open Standard (Required, if applicable)

The Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation is a globally utilized
nomenclature for conservation. Including these keywords helps to align the work
of USFWS Science Applications with global conservation efforts and to utilize
the shared resources of the Conservation Standards Network. The open standards
keywords for conservation actions are as listed:

### GCMD Keywords (Best Practice)

GCMD stands for Global Change Master Directory and these keywords are maintained
by NASA. Look for useful keywords in the GCMD Science Keywords. There are GCMD
Platforms and Instruments Keywords but they are unlikely to apply to LCCs.

:::{.callout-info}
Best Practice: Check the "Full Path" checkbox to save
the full path of the keyword to your metadata. This will maintain the category
and context of the specific keywords chosen. 
:::

## Custom Thesaurus

If any of your desired keywords do not appear in the existing thesauruses, you
can add them via the custom thesaurus. Use a custom thesaurus only for keywords
that are not available in an existing thesaurus.

You cannot add keywords to an existing thesaurus; you can only add keywords in a
custom thesaurus. If a region or program finds the need for the additional of
keywords to an existing thesaurus or the need for another thesaurus, please
contact the FWS SA National Data Steward.

:::{.callout-info} 
You cannot save a custom thesaurus in mdEditor. 
:::

:::{.callout-info} 
Tip: If you have a consistent set of keywords that you
use across your projects, you could add these to a "template project" record in
mdEditor and then modify the specific keywords you need for each project. See
the workflow section for more info about using template records.
:::

## Keywords and ScienceBase Tags

### Keywords vs. Tags

mdEditor uses the term "keywords" while ScienceBase uses the term "tags."

:::{.callout-info} 
Keywords edited in mdEditor will not overwrite keywords
stored in sbJSON on ScienceBase because ScienceBase only adds to the list of
tags. If you want to remove obsolete keywords/tags on ScienceBase, you will need
to manually delete them in ScienceBase. mdJSON and the SA Science Catalog,
however, will reflect the changes made in mdEditor. 
:::

### Imported Keywords

If you imported your project metadata from ScienceBase, then the ScienceBase
keywords are included in a custom thesaurus.

If your LCC already has a controlled vocab list in ScienceBase, unfortunately it
cannot connect to mdEditor. The selected keywords for any specific record will
import into mdEditor, but the saved list will not be.

The **Documents** tab is where you can add references to resources that *relate*
to your project but do not *define* or *describe* the project. These can include
videos, webinars, books, posters, web pages, news releases, etc. This should not
include links to the project or its products. An example document could be a
report for a workshop that inspired the project.

There are no specific requirements or best practices for documents.

::: {.callout-note}
ScienceBase has a similar section called "weblinks."
These will be populated in the Documents section if sbJSON is imported into
mdEditor.

For more information, consult the Documents section of the mdEditor manual.

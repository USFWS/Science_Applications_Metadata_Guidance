## Must Do QA/QC Fixes

### Main

\(1\) Products need to have a specific resource type selected (not “product”)
AND they need to be valid resource types. See [QA/QC list from DJ
Case](https://lccnetwork.org/science-catalog/api/item/qaqcIssues).

### Main/Citation

\(2\) Responsible Parties need to have a valid role selected. See [QA/QC list
from DJ Case](https://lccnetwork.org/science-catalog/api/item/qaqcIssues).

### Metadata Repositories

(3a) Ensure you have a single version of your data.gov tag and it is consistent
across all of your items. See [ScienceBase
scanner](http://calcommons.info/sb2/scansb.php).

(3b) If you update your Metadata Repositories in mdJSON and publish to
ScienceBase, you will also need to delete the erroneous version from ScienceBase
(called Harvest Sets in SB). The issue is that SB doesn’t remove tags when an
item is republished, it just adds to tags. This issue applies to all keywords,
but it is most important to fix for Harvest Sets. This scenario can happen with
both erroneous data.gov tags or misspelled Harvest Set tagging.

You may want to consider using the injector script to delete or replace
erroneous versions from mdJSON. You would still be required required to manually
remove the erroneous versions from SB items.

### Funding

\(4\) LCC allocations need to list the funding agency as the source (e.g., U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service), not the LCC. See [QA/QC list from DJ
Case](https://lccnetwork.org/science-catalog/api/item/qaqcIssues).

-   Additionally, all funding from other FWS programs need to list FWS as the
    source (and not list the source as Fisheries, specific Refuges, ES, etc.).
    Clarifications on the exact program or refuge where the funding came from
    can be done through the Funding/Other Contacts field (and choose the role of
    "administrator").

\(5\) All allocations should list the fiscal year when the funds were allocated
(this is different than a project's overall start and end dates - those are
entered in Main/Time Period). There should be only a single fiscal year
identified per allocation. Use the “Pick a Fiscal Year” dropdown to autofill the
date fields.

\(6\) All allocation recipients should be an Organization, not an Individual
contact. Clarifications, although not required, can be done through the
Funding/Other Contacts field (e.g., list a "principalInvestigator").

### Contacts

\(7\) All contacts need the appropriate contactType identified—this is
particularly important for funding summaries. See [QA/QC list from DJ
Case](https://lccnetwork.org/science-catalog/api/item/qaqcIssues).

\(8\) Address the [Contact QA/QC list from DJ
Case](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eUeDjCFpLIiVksmkmzL7-BoBr8ai8rl09FBDIh7Xe3w).

-   Note: this is a static list that was generated during the initial creation
    of the Science Catalog. The spreadsheet will not update when you fix an
    issue listed. Please update the "Fixed" column to "yes" when you have
    addressed a particular item.

### Keywords

\(9\) Fix “consevation design” Typo. Select correct option in mdEditor and
re-publish. Affected records can be viewed
[here](https://lccnetwork.org/catalog#/eJxlT7GOwjAM/ZXIqlSQEOLWbohbEAMDI2LwJaayzjglCQWu6r9fgjpwus3vPfs9vwFaUgoo0AzwTc+7Dy6WWXzLFmXfZTH5AA2gOliADZwoMEJzHKBHuVGWNl4j9ZjYq3EUuVUYT+O4gMp6TcG/3Kue6Z6XE34JZaeqw5YO/JMNPlarCW/V0QOaAqMP6ZMD2WJb8qOFiV5nri/BkS+d8JnJLcVaKIlnlvzgH80oGb2JmFzBzN5uUGQ3dTZ0NfX/HvUcxl+N0GTK)
(this is a link to a saved Science Catalog search for the erroneous keyword).

### Distribution

\(10\) Distribution links need to be included for products. This was already
required for all products and this is particularly critical for items sent to
data.gov. This is the only online resource data.gov reads so without a URL here,
there is no way for a user to access the actual product. The recommended role is
"distributor" (see the [Product
Distribution](../../product-entry-guidance/distribution.md) section for more
info).

Note: Matt Heller is looking into a solution (mid-November) using the injector
script so data managers could run this automated process themselves to meet
minimum requirements.

### Fixing Errors

\(11\) Republish any records that don’t have mdJSON attached (without mdJSON,
the item will not show up in the Science Catalog). See
[ScienceBase scanner](http://calcommons.info/sb2/scansb.php).

\(12\) Go through errors/warnings in the [ScienceBase
scanner](http://calcommons.info/sb2/scansb.php) (e.g., no ISO Keyword, bad repo
tag, etc.) .

\(13\) Address remaining [QA/QC issues from DJ
Case](https://lccnetwork.org/science-catalog/api/item/qaqcIssues).

\(14\) Fix the errors identified by the ASG in manual QA/QC checks of the
Science Catalog. [See
list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eUeDjCFpLIiVksmkmzL7-BoBr8ai8rl09FBDIh7Xe3w/edit#gid=117396702).

\(15\) Template scripting introduced some errors for some LCCs. Fixing these may
be most effective with the injector script. Specific details related to these
issues will be discussed with those who used the template scripting.

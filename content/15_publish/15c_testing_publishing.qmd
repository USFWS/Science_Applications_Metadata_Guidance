Note: Please use a testing folder before you update your
real records. Consult the [**Instructions for Testing
Publishing**](https://github.com/tpatterson1996/lcc-metadata-manual/tree/287090b07635d0e76a714278ce1f6c4aac3594cc/publish/instructions-for-testing-publishing.md)
section for more information.

1.  Determine your workflow for testing:

    If you **DO NOT** already have items on ScienceBase. Choose a project and
    its products to test.

    **BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE**: It's recommended that you export a project and
    its products into its own mdEditor file. Set default parent identifier as a
    ScienceBase folder.

    If you **DO** already have items on ScienceBase, choose one of the following
    approaches. *Note that this procedure may affect your existing records.*

    ***Approach 1*** - Take a simple project and product set, and make a copy of
    the mdEditor records. In the test version, delete all ScienceBase IDs
    (SBIDs) and parent IDs. The SBID will either be located in the citation, or
    if you imported the record from SB, the SBID will be the record identifier.
    Set default parent identifier as a folder.

    ***Approach 2***- Publish directly to a real record if you have confirmed a
    backup copy exists, in the event that the record is deleted in ScienceBase.

2.  Set your **Default Parent Identifier** in Settings.

3.  Select one project with its associated products to test.

4.  Follow the publishing instructions above for the scenario that applies to
    you.

5.  Look for any errors in the third column. If you see an error that is 400 and
    red, it’s a problem that you can address. However, if it’s a 500 level error
    in red, that is a ScienceBase error that is outside the scope of the
    mdEditor.

7.  **NOTE:** Any unsolvable issues can be submitted on the issues page for
    mdEditor:
    [https://github.com/adiwg/mdEditor/issues](https://www.gitbook.com/book/adiwg/mdeditor/edit#).
    You must have a github account in order to post.

    Advanced users can check errors using the console. Consult the **Advanced
    Users** section of this manual to learn more.

8.  Verify that your test records have published as expected in your folder on
    ScienceBase (or to the real record if that’s how you are testing).

9.  After you are satisfied with how your test records published to ScienceBase,
    continue to step 10.

10. Update your mdEditor settings to your real Default Parent Identifier.

11. Using the record you just tested, proceed with publishing to the real
    location on ScienceBase.

12. Make sure any test SBIDs are removed entirely from the record you want to
    actually publish.

13. Verify that the real records have updated as expected.

14. Proceed with publishing your other records to their real locations. It is
    advisable to publish 1 or 2 records at a time, since ScienceBase can
    time-out and fail when publishing records simultaneously.

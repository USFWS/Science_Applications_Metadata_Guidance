A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a globally unique, persistent, and
resolvable identifier used to uniquely identify objects and are widely used to
identify academic, professional, and government information (e.g., journal
articles, research reports, data sets, official publications). Think of it as a
Social Security Number for your data. DOIs are standardized by the International
Organization of Standards (ISO). DOIs are connected to the asset in perpetuity
through a DOI hosting service (e.g., DataCite or CrossRef) that maintains the
link to the resource.

DOIs should be assigned to Service-funded assets such as datasets, services,
models, and reports, with the exception of research publications where journals
assign the DOIs. Using DOIs promotes discovery and re-useability of the
Service’s work and investments in data and ensures appropriate recognition for
those collecting and properly managing data assets.

For more information on DOIs, see [Digital Object Identifier
Handbook](https://www.doi.org/hb.html).

The Service [**Digital Object Identifier Management
Tool**](https://www1.usgs.gov/fws/doi/) enables Service personnel to assign
DOIs, registered with [DataCite](https://datacite.org/), to Service-funded data
products and other resources. This tool is used to mint (create), update,
publish, administer, and search for Service DOIs. DOI required metadata includes
the asset title, creator(s), publication date, type of data product, abstract,
dates relevant to the resource, and an online link to the permanent repository
location of resource and can be updated at any time.

Once minted, the DOI is included as an identifier in your metadata record
(Figure 2)

This Tool was developed and is managed by the United States Geological Survey
(USGS) [Science Analytics and Synthesis
(SAS)](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/science-analytics-and-synthesis)
Science Data Management Branch, under an interagency agreement with the Service.

DOIs generated by this tool should be assigned to Service-funded data products
(such as data releases, services, models, and reports), with the exception of
primary research publications published in one of the Service’s journals which
are assigned through a process governed by the National Conservation Training
Center. To generate data product DOIs, you need to submit brief citation
metadata, including the title, creator(s), publication date, type of data
product, abstract, dates relevant to the data, and an online link to the data.
These citation metadata can be updated at any time.

Before you being, collect required metadata information as follows:

| Metadata         | Required? |
|:-----------------|:----------|
| Title            | Required  |
| Resource Type    | Required  |
| Point of Contact | Required  |
| Date             | Required  |
| Abstract         | Required  |
| Repository URL   | Required  |

### Creating and maintaining a DOI

The DOI Tool is designed to be user friendly and guide you through the process
to mint, populate metadata, publish, and administer DOIs. It is important to
note that there is both a “beta” and “live” version of the DOI. The [beta
version](https://www1-beta.usgs.gov/fws/doi/) is useful as a training resource
to become familiar with the DOI Tool.. The [live
version](https://www1.usgs.gov/fws/doi/index.htm) is where you go to actually
create a DOI, which can be set to hidden or public. DOIs assigned through the
live version have a prefix of 10.7944.

To login to the DOI Tool:

1.  Use your Service email address and password. Once logged in, you will have
    “read-only” access to any record, “write” access to records that you created
    and to those where you have been added as a “Manager”.

#### Minting a DOI

Minting a DOI creates and reserves a DOI and DOI URL and does NOT require fully
populated metadata fields. The benefit to minting the DOI early, such as in the
Planning or Access Phase of the data lifecycle is efficiency. The DOI can be
referencing in related documentation, metadata, and other elements of the
project, reducing the need for updating later.

To mint a DOI, follow these steps:

2.  Enter our existing metadata into the DOI Tool following the instructions
    provided on the site. New users are encouraged to review the “NEW USER?”
    section in the login page (Figure 1). The DOI does not need to be published
    publicly until the DOI metadata is completed.

![New User Instructions on the Login Page](../assets/doi_login_new_user.png)

The DOI is comprised of the resolvable service url, the registered prefix and a
product identifier suffix (Figure 2). Service DOI are assigned the prefix of
**10.7964.** The DOI URL can be used as a weblink to the registered asset.

3.  Once created, the DOI is ready for use asset related metadata, reports,
    publications, and other elements that need to refer to DOIs as soon as
    necessary.

4.  During the maintain phase of the data lifecycle, any empty fields in the DOI
    metadata should be updated.

5.  Once the fields in the DOI metadata are fully populated, publish the DOI.
    This creates the digital tether to the URL for the data resource landing
    page.

6.  You can administer the DOI at any time using the DOI tools dashboard(s). See
    the DOI Administration section below for more information.

7.  Include the DOI as an identifier in your metadata record (Figure 2b). As an
    identifier, only the prefix and suffix are needed.

8.  Include the DOI as an online resource in your metadata record (Figure 2c).
    In this case the entire DOI url is needed.

### DOI Administration

The Service has secured a large, yet limited bank (range) of DOIs. Once minted,
the DOI is valid in perpetuity. If you are new to the DOI, please get familiar
with the tool in the training [beta
version](https://www1-beta.usgs.gov/fws/doi/). When ready to officially reserve
a DOI, use the [live version](https://www1.usgs.gov/fws/doi/index.htm) of the
tool. The DOI tool was not intended to be used do not for data assets that were
not initiated, funded, or delivered as part of a Service project.

To date the Service has not identified a responsible party or governance for
administering DOIs within the Service. As a result, the duties of DOI
administration must fall to the collective of Service DOI creators/editors. DOI
administration duties include:

Ensuring minted DOIs are being used for their intended purpose, which includes:

-   Minimizing the number of DOIs being minted and never published,
    -   Ensuring one DOI per digital object (e.g. research reports, data sets,
        service, etc.)
    -   Ensuring URL paths are still resolvable (no broken web links attached to
        the DOI)
-   Providing usage reports
-   Helping to reconcile previous DOIs from other DOI services
-   Enhancing supplemental DOI metadata

Each Service program, currently without enterprise level governance, has the
option to administer the assignment of DOIs to their data assets within their
program such that it meets their workflow. While the tool is available for any
Service employee to login and create a DOI, a program may prefer to have a
process to trigger a review or notification before a DOI is created. For
example, an employee may login and create a DOI during planning set the DOI to
hidden until the data and set edit rights to other accountable data staff. Once
completed and approved, the DOI status can be set to public.

### Bulk DOI Creation and Updates API

This tool also has an optional Web API (application programming interface)
component for the automated creation and editing of DOIs and may be useful for
bulk creation of DOIs through scripting/programming. After logging into the tool
with your Department of Interior Active Directory credentials, see the DOI API
link for more information.

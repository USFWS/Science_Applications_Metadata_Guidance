The **Constraint** tab allows you to enter information into the metadata about
how the resource can and cannot be used. This section is under review for FOIA, 
Records Management, and Privacy Policy, so changes may be forthcoming.

## Legal

### Access Constraints [(Required)]`r req_style`
Access constraints are applied to assure the protection of privacy or 
intellectual property and any special restrictions or limitations on obtaining 
the resource.

### Use Constraints [(If applicable)]`r if_style`
How the product should be used.

### Other constraints 
This is a place to put standard disclaimers.

Constraints are limited to four categories:  **Open**, **Limited Access**, 
, **Sensitive/Protected** and **Restricted**. git

<!-- Originally: Open, Limited Access, Sensitive/Protected, and Restricted. --->

#### Open Access

default in the U.S. Public Domain. If no other open license applies, the
following URL should be used in the license field.

#### Limited Access

#### Sensitive/Protected Access

#### Restricted Access

### Security Constraints 

#### Classification [(If applicable)]`r if_style`

A place to describe constraints or restrictions pertaining to security
of the resource. Choose security classification from the drop-down menu. 
For products without restrictions, best practice is to select ***unclassified*** 
from the menu.

::: {.callout-note}
Classification is the class of security (e.g., top secret, public access).

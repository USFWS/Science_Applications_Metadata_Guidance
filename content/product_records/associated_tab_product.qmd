The **Associated** section is used to connect metadata records with each other.
This feature should be used when items are related. For example, products are
often the result of projects, and projects can have sub-projects. Projects and
products can be linked together by using an association. Adding associations
will allow users to find items that relate to each other quickly and easily.

::: {.callout-note}
In ScienceBase, **Associated Records** are referred to
as **Item Associations**.

::: {.callout-note}
Remember: Project-product associations are different
than parent-child relationships on ScienceBase.

## Create Associations

In mdEditor, the association can be created either from the Project record or
the Product record. The "Association Type" will define the association from your
current record to the linked record. Specifying the "Linked Association Type"
will create the association from the other direction.

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
Important: It is recommended you ALWAYS specify the Linked Association Type 
when you create associations. This will ensure the associations are defined 
from both directions and be present in the metadata regardless of how the 
metadata is translated or where it is used in the future.
:::

If records are imported from ScienceBase, the record associations might be
automatically created, but sometimes the associations may need to be recreated
manually (as described below). Associations can only be made after both project
and product records have been created in mdEditor.

### Step-by-Step: Creating an Association in a Product Record

**Step 1**: Select "**parentProject**" from the **Association Type** drop-down
menu. This field will describe the relationship from the associated record to
the product record (the associated record is the parentProject of the product
record you are editing).

The Metadata tab describes your project's metadata, including a description that
outlines the process of metadata creation, contributors to the creation of the
metadata, and metadata repositories.

## Basic Information

### Metadata Status [(Required)]`r req_style`

Select the appropriate **Status** of the creation of your metadata from the
drop-down menu. For example, if you have added all of your metadata, select
***completed***. If you still have metadata to add, select ***onGoing***.

### Dates [(Required)]`r req_style`

Enter a **Date** for ***creation*** or ***last updated*** date. 
<u>At least one</u> of these dates is required.

## Metadata Contacts

**Metadata Contacts** are required and selected from your list of contacts.
Adding a metadata contact will give people a contact point should they have
any questions about the metadata.

| Role           | Contact          | **Requirements              |
|:---------------|:-----------------|:-------------------------|
| author         | See Notes Below  | [Required]`r req_style` |       |
| publisher      | Default is USFWS | [Required]`r req_style` |       |
| pointOfContact | SA Data Steward  | [Required]`r req_style` |       |
: {.striped .hover .bordered .md .allborder}

**Metadata Contact Notes:**

-   The author should be an individual and can be a generic data manager.
-   In most cases, the author will be the data manager, but could be anyone,
    including someone outside of FWS (e.g., imported FGDC metadata can list the
    original author).
-   Publisher can also include the FWS region and/or program.
-   The point of contact should be a regional or national data steward.

## Metadata Identifier

The **Metadata Identifier** is automatically populated by mdEditor. The metadata
identifier gives each of your projects and products a unique ID and
differentiates them from other similar projects and products. Note this is
difference from a Digital Object Identifier which is linked directly to the
dataset.

-   If the record was imported from ScienceBase, the Metadata Identifier will be
    auto-populated with the ScienceBase ID (SBID).
-   If the record was created in mdEditor, it will generate a universally unique
    identifier (UUID).

:::{.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
Once a Metadata Identifier is created in the metadata,
do not change it. mdEditor uses the Metadata Identifier to connect records and
changing the Metadata Identifier can break those connections. If there are
additional identifiers you want to include in your metadata record, include them
in [Main/Citation/Identifier](main_tab_product.qmd#identifier).

## Parent Metadata [(Required)]`r req_style`

**Parent Metadata** defines the ScienceBase folder in which the product will be
published. The parent metadata tells mdEditor where the product metadata should
go when it is published to ScienceBase.

If you imported the product metadata from ScienceBase originally, this section
will be populated already.

If you created the product metadata from scratch in mdEditor, you need to enter
the appropriate parent item ScienceBase ID. This is most likely the folder for
the project that this product originated from.

#### Title [(Required)]`r req_style`

If the **Title** is not already populated, you can enter something like 
"Parent Folder".

#### Identifier [(Required)]`r req_style`

The **Identifier** defines the location of the parent folder in ScienceBase.

:::{.callout-hint appearance="minimal"}
The ScienceBase identifier is the alphanumeric string in
the item's URL immediately following "**item/**". For example,
**66326ad6d34ea70bd5f26d5f** is the SBID for the item at the URL:
<https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/66326ad6d34ea70bd5f26d5f>

## Metadata Repositories [(Required)]`r req_style`

**Metadata Repositories** indicate where the metadata will be sent upon
publishing.

### SA Science Catalog

For products that should be listed in the SA Science Catalog: Select
*“ScienceCatalog”* from the repository list. *“SA Science Catalog”* should
automatically show up as the collection title. If the collection title does not
appear, stop and enter the correct information in [Settings](../settings.qmd).
Then select the repository for your project. Products without the correct tag
and collection title will not show up in the Science Catalog.

### data.gov

For products that should be sent to data.gov: Select "data.gov" from the
repository list. The full name of your data.gov tag should automatically show up
in the collection title. If the collection title does not appear, stop and enter
the correct information in [Settings](../settings.qmd). Then select the
data.gov repository for your product. Products without the correct tag and
collection title will not be sent to data.gov.

:::{.callout-warning} 
The Metadata Repository and Collection Title must be
exactly the same for each of your records with no variations in spelling,
spaces, capitalization, etc. Specifying this information in Settings is the best
way to ensure the repository information will be consistent across all of your
records. It strongly recommended that you do not type these in by hand on
individual metadata records.

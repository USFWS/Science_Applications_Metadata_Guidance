**Lineage** is used to track the process of building datasets. It is most
relevant for spatial datasets, but can be used for any dataset. Lineage entries
are used to describe the steps and sources used to create the product, and
document the roles and contacts for the product contributors. Completing the
lineage tab is recommended, but not required.

    and integrate the resource.

    Step**](../product_records/lineage_tab_product.qmd#product-records-process-step)
    section of this manual to learn how to add information about the creation of
    your project.

Adding keywords to your metadata record allows for the record to be found later
through a search engine, keywords are the way to tag your projects or products.
The mdEditor is designed using thesauruses that contain pre-determined keywords.
These thesauruses create a 'controlled vocabulary' so that all SA staff adding
metadata can adhere to the same standards, and future search results can return
clear results of projects and products.

## To add Keywords to your Metadata Record

1.  Click “+ Add Thesaurus” on the right to add the different thesauruses.
2.  Add keywords from the following pre-populated thesauruses.
3.  If none of the keywords in the following categories are sufficient for
    tagging your record, you can create a custom thesaurus (see below for more
    information).

### Product Required Keywords

#### ISO Topic Category (Required)

Because mdJSON metadata is based on the ISO (International Organization for
Standardization) metadata standard, all projects should select at least one
ISO Topic Category. ISO topics were generally meant for spatial data so they
might be a bit of a stretch, but do your best to find the best fit. mdEditor
provides definitions of each ISO topic category if you hover over the **?**
icon.

Choose all that apply. The ISO Topic list is as follows:

|                                   |
|-----------------------------------|
| biota                             |
| boundaries                        |

| economy                           |
| elevation                         |
| environment                       |

Biota and environment are probably the best fit for most SA products.

#### GCMD Keywords (Best Practice)

GCMD stands for Global Change Master Directory and these keywords are maintained
by NASA. Look for useful keywords in the GCMD Science Keywords. There are GCMD
Platforms and Instruments Keywords but they are unlikely to apply to SA
products.

::: {.callout-hint appearance="minimal"}
Best Practice: Check the "Full Path" checkbox to save the full path of the
keyword to your metadata. This will maintain the category and context of the
specific keywords chosen.
:::

## Custom Thesaurus

If any of your desired keywords do not appear in the existing thesauruses, you
can add them via the custom thesaurus. Use a custom thesaurus only for keywords
that are not available in an existing thesaurus.

You cannot add keywords to an existing thesaurus; you can only add keywords in a
custom thesaurus.

::: {.callout-hint appearance="minimal"}
You cannot save a custom thesaurus in mdEditor.

::: {.callout-hint appearance="minimal"}
Tip: If you have a consistent set of keywords that you use across your projects
or products, you could add these to a "template project" record in mdEditor and
then modify the specific keywords you need for each entry. See the workflow
section for more info about using template records.

::: {.callout-hint appearance="minimal"}
Look for useful keywords in the GCMD Science Keywords. GCMD Science keywords are
the most applicable to SA. There are GCMD Platforms and Instruments keywords,
but they are unlikely to apply to SA.

## Keywords and ScienceBase

### Keywords vs. Tags

mdEditor uses the term "keywords" while ScienceBase uses the term "tags."

::: {.callout-hint appearance="minimal"}
Keywords edited in mdEditor will not overwrite keywords stored in ScienceBase
(i.e. sbJSON) because ScienceBase only adds to the list of tags. If you do not
want obsolete keywords/tags to show up on ScienceBase, manually delete these in
ScienceBase. mdJSON and the SA Science Catalog, however, will reflect any
changes made in mdEditor.
:::

### Imported Keywords

If you imported your product metadata from ScienceBase, then the ScienceBase
tags are each created as a keyword in a custom thesaurus.

Controlled vocab list in ScienceBase cannot connect to mdEditor. The selected
keywords for any specific record will import into mdEditor, but the saved list
will not be.

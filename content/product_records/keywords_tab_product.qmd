Adding keywords to your metadata record allows for the record to be found later
through a search engine, keywords are the way to tag your projects or products.
The mdEditor is designed using thesauruses that contain pre-determined keywords.
These thesauruses create a 'controlled vocabulary' so that all SA staff adding
metadata can adhere to the same standards, and future search results can return
clear results of projects and products.

## To add Keywords to your Product Record

1.  Click “+ Add Thesaurus” on the right to add the different thesauruses.
2.  Add keywords from the following pre-populated thesauruses.
3.  If none of the keywords in the following categories are sufficient for
    tagging your record, you can create a custom thesaurus (see below for more
    information).

### ISO Topic Category ([Required]`r req_style`)

Because mdJSON metadata is based on the ISO (International Organization for
Standardization) metadata standard, all SA projects should select at least one
ISO Topic Category. ISO topics were generally meant for spatial data so they
might be a bit of a stretch, bu do your best to find the best fit. mdEditor
provides definitions of each ISO topic category if you hover over the ? icon.

Choose all that apply. The ISO Topic list is as follows:

|                                   |
|-----------------------------------|
| biota                             |

Biota and environment are probably the best fit for most SA projects.

### Conservation Action Open Standard ([If applicable]`r if_style`)

The Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation is a globally utilized
nomenclature for conservation. Including these keywords helps to align the work
of USFWS Science Applications with global conservation efforts and to utilize
the shared resources of the Conservation Standards Network. The open standards
keywords for conservation actions are as listed:

### Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) ([Best Practice]`r best_style`)

**GCMD** stands for Global Change Master Directory and these keywords are 
maintained by NASA. Look for useful keywords in the GCMD Science Keywords. 
There are GCMD Platforms and Instruments Keywords but they are unlikely to 
apply to SA projects.

:::{.callout-tip icon=false title="Best Practice"}
Check the "Full Path" checkbox to save the full path of the 
keyword to your metadata. This will maintain the category and context of the 
specific keywords chosen. 
:::

## Custom Thesaurus

If any of your desired keywords do not appear in the existing thesauruses, you
can add them via the custom thesaurus. Use a custom thesaurus only for keywords
that are not available in an existing thesaurus.

You cannot add keywords to an existing thesaurus; you can only add keywords in a
custom thesaurus. If a region or program finds the need for the additional of
keywords to an existing thesaurus or the need for another thesaurus, please
contact the FWS SA National Data Steward.

:::{.callout-tip icon=false}  
You cannot save a custom thesaurus in mdEditor. 

If you have a consistent set of keywords that you
use across your projects, you could add these to a "template project" record in
mdEditor and then modify the specific keywords you need for each project. See
the workflow section for more info about using template records.
:::    


## Keywords and ScienceBase

### Keywords vs. Tags

mdEditor uses the term "keywords" while ScienceBase uses the term "tags."

::: {.callout-hint icon=false}
Keywords edited in mdEditor will not overwrite keywords stored in ScienceBase
(i.e. sbJSON) because ScienceBase only adds to the list of tags. If you do not
want obsolete keywords/tags to show up on ScienceBase, manually delete these in
ScienceBase. mdJSON and the SA Science Catalog, however, will reflect any
changes made in mdEditor.
:::

### Imported Keywords

If you imported your product metadata from ScienceBase, then the ScienceBase
tags are each created as a keyword in a custom thesaurus.

Controlled vocab list in ScienceBase cannot connect to mdEditor. The selected
keywords for any specific record will import into mdEditor, but the saved list
will not be.

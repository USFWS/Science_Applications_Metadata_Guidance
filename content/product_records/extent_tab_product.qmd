**Extent** refers to geographic boundaries for your project. Spatial extents
lets users see at a glance the geographic footprint of your project and allows
searching within specific geographic areas.

| Extent Tab | Requirements |

Spatial extents should be included for all applicable products. As a default,
products should inherit extents from their parent project. geoJSON files for
specific geographies are available on
[ScienceBase](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5bd7c96fe4b0b3fc5ce82d44)
(private DMWG folder that requires ScienceBase login). Download the relevant
files and then import the geoJSON files into mdEditor.

Tip: You can export, save, and import an extent to use for other projects or 
products.

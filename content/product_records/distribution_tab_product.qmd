**Distribution** provides documentation on how or where users can obtain
products. Distribution methods may include online options (e.g., website,
database) or offline options (e.g., delivery via mail, library).

::: {.callout-hint}
An online distribution link is required for any products
sent to data.gov.

Click **Add Distribution Section** and then **Edit Distributors** to begin
adding distributors.*

## Distributor

This section involves adding distributor information and a URL for data products
that are hosted anywhere. For example, if The Nature Conservancy is hosting a
data source, the distributor is "The Nature Conservancy."

### Contacts and Role [(If applicable)]`r if_style`

If anything is filled out in the distribution section, a **Contact** must be 
added. The appropriate **Role** is "distributor."

The contact should ideally be someone who will remain available to respond to
potential inquiries about the product. If there is not an appropriate contact
specific to the product, you can use a generic SA Data Steward contact for a
long-term backup contact.

## Transfer Options

Transfer Options provide details regarding obtaining the product. Online and
offline options are available.

### Online Option

#### Name [(If applicable)]`r if_style`

The Name of the online resource should be something that indicates it is a
product page where the data can be downloaded. Examples: "product webpage" or
"Product Webpage with Downloadable Files." If there are multiple files for a
single product record, the Name should be different for each file so the user
can differentiate between them. For example, "Download Aguiguan Veg 2016 data"
or "Download FDM Veg 2011 data."

::: {.callout-note}
Unique Names for multiple files are particularly
important for items being sent to data.gov. Without a name specified at all, the
link will display as "webpage," which isn't particularly informative to users.
Identical names for different files also won't be particularly informative. 
:::

#### URI [(If applicable)]`r if_style`

The most important thing to enter is the URL where the product can be accessed
or downloaded.

::: {.callout-note}
An online link is required for any products sent to
data.gov. Preferably the link should be a direct download to the data and not an
intermediary page. 
:::

#### Function [(If applicable)]`r if_style`

In the Function field, you should indicate the type of URL. If the link is a
direct download of the data, select “download.” If the link goes to an
informational page, select “information.”

#### How to obtain download link from ScienceBase Items

For products hosted on ScienceBase, obtaining the direct download URL is a
little tricky. The text displayed on the ScienceBase page under Attached Files
is not actually a link (so you can't right-click and copy link address from
there). Here are directions for how to obtain the direct download link for
ScienceBase items.

\(1\) First scroll to the Attached Files on the ScienceBase item and click the
Attach Files control.

\(2\) From the list of attached files, find the relevant file, right click the
name, and select "copy link address." Then paste that link into the Online
Option in mdEditor.

### Offline Option

If your product is only available offline, describe how users can obtain the
product here.

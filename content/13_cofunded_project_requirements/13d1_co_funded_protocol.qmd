There are two types of co-funded protocols.

1\) One or more region or program provides funding for a project and the project
can not be divided into distinct sub-projects to be attributed separately to any
region or program. In this case, follow the[FWS co-funded
Projects](for-multi-lcc-projects.md) guidance.

2\) A project is funded by a Service regional program AND by a CASC or other DOI
agency where the project can not be divided into distinct sub-projects to be
attributed separately. In this case follow, [the FWS/CASC
Projects](for-lcccasc-projects.md) guidance.

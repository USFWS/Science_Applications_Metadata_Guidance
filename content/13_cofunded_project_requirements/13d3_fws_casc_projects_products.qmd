## Applicability

-   One or more Service regions or programs provides funding support for a
    project with one or more USGS Climate Adaptation Science Center (CASC) or
    other DOI agency where distinct sub-projects or products cannot be
    separately identified and attributed to either agency.

## Metadata Responsibility

This protocol was developed with the CASCc and therefore, focuses on their
specific needs, but may be applied to other DOI agency collaborations. The
Service data manager is responsible communications with the partner agency and
for processing the project and product metadata for inclusion in the SA Science
Catalog. The CASC data manager will complete their metadata responsibilities for
the CASC records independently according to their requirements.

## Co-funded Project Workflow

For projects and products co-funded with the CASC, the CASCs will create their
own ScienceBase items according to their requirements. In order for those
projects and products to be included in the SA Science Catalog, a duplicate
metadata records need to be created and linked to the CASC metadata records.
While duplicate metadata records are not the preferred option, the specific
individual requirements for each agency warrants this system.

The general approach is to make a copy of the CASC metadata in mdEditor, modify
the metadata to meet SA metadata requirements, including the repository tag for
the Science Catalog, **add a statement in the abstract explaining the
collaboration**, and include a url link to the CASC ScienceBase record. The
statement in the abstract and the links to the CASC ScienceBase records will
clarify that these are alternate references for the same item (not duplicative
efforts), and in the case of products, provide access to the actual
data/tool/etc. hosted on ScienceBase. These additions are detailed below.

### Workflow Option 1

1.  Import the sbJSON for the CASC record.
2.  Delete the SBIDs specific to the CASC record.
3.  Modify the metadata to meet SA metadata requirements.
4.  Complete the additional metadata requirements as described below.

### Workflow Option 2

1.  Create a record from scratch in mdEditor.
2.  Copy the title, abstract, and other pertinent info from the CASC ScienceBase
    record.
3.  Complete the additional metadata requirements for a co-funded project as
    described below.

## Main/Point of Contacts

Add all collaborating Service regions/programs and CASCs as “collaborator.”

{% hint style="info" %} The lead Service region/program should be listed as
“administrator” and does not need to be added as a “collaborator.” {% endhint %}

*Figure 1: Example of mdEditor entry for Main/Point of Contact*

## Main/Citation/Online Resource

Include the link to the CASC's ScienceBase project page as an online resource.

-   Name the link with “X Climate Adaptation Science Center ScienceBase Project
    Page.”

## Main/Abstract

Add the following text as the last sentence:

“This project was co-funded by the USFWS region \[A, B, C\] and \[X, Y, Z\]
Climate Adaptation Science Centers. An alternate reference to this project can
be found here: \[insert CASC ScienceBase URL\].”

-   Example: “This project was co-funded by the USFWS Southeast region 2 and the
    South Central Climate Adaptation Science Center. An alternate reference to
    this project can be found here:
    <https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5887c1c3e4b02e34393da82d>.”

The CASC will include a parallel statement in the Summary field for their
ScienceBase record (and link back to the this record).

## Main/Supplemental Information

Add the following text (Best Practice):

“This product was co-funded by the \[A, B, C\] Landscape Conservation
Cooperatives and \[X, Y, Z\] Climate Adaptation Science Centers. An alternate
reference to this product can be found here: \[insert CASC ScienceBase URL\].”

-   Example: “This project was co-funded by the Gulf Coast Prairie Landscape
    Conservation Cooperative and the South Central Climate Adaptation Science
    Center. An alternate reference to this product can be found here:
    <https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5887c1c3e4b02e34393da82d>.”

## Meta**d**ata/Metadata Contacts

Include the USFWS as “publisher.”

Collaborators do not need to be listed here.

## Funding (Project Only)

### Service Allocations

Add a separate funding allocation for each year and each Service program or
region that provided funding.

1.  For SA allocations, the source should be U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
2.  Add the funding Service program or region as the “administrator” in the
    Other Contacts section (see Figure 2).

2: Example of mdEditor entry for an SA funding allocation.*

### CASC Allocations

1.  List the source of CASC allocations as U.S. Geological Survey.
2.  Add the funding CASC as the “administrator” in the Other Contacts section.
3.  Check the matching funds box (see Figure 3).

*Figure 3: Example of mdEditor entry for a CASC funding allocation.*

## Associated

Since the CASC metadata is outside the SA communities in ScienceBase, manually
associate the CASC projects both in mdEditor Associated and directly in
ScienceBase.

### Associations in mdEditor

Manually associate the CASC project as an “alternate” relationship in the
Associated tab in mdEditor.

1.  Populate the association type as “alternate”.
2.  Enter the appropriate resource type.
3.  Copy the CASC’s project title to the title field.
4.  Enter the CASC as the “administrator” in the Responsible Parties section.
5.  Add the CASC ScienceBase item URL in the Online Resource field. This is
    important to provide discovery and access to items outside of the SA Science
    Catalog (see Figure 4).
6.  Add the ScienceBase Identifier of the CASC project.

4: Example of mdEditor entry for Online Resource. Online resource links must be
added for associated items that do NOT have metadata in the SA Science Catalog
in order to ensure access and discoverability.*

### Associations in ScienceBase

The only associations that ScienceBase recognizes from mdJSON are
parentProject/product relationships so it will not recognize the “alternate”
association created in mdEditor. This association must be added by hand directly
in ScienceBase.

1.  Log in to your ScienceBase account to edit the appropriate ScienceBase item.
2.  Click “Associate an Item” from the right side column of the ScienceBase
    page.
3.  Add an “alternate” association to the CASC ScienceBase item (see Figure 5).

5: Example of entering an association directly in ScienceBase. From the SA
project record, select “Associate an Item” and enter the SBID of the CASC
project record and select “alternate” as the relationship type.*

## Distribution (Product only)

Include the CASC weblinks and identifiers that were entered in the mdEditor
Associated tab in the Online Resource section.

-   List the role of the CASC as “owner.”

The Distribution links are critical for providing access to the actual
data/tool/etc.

## Notifying CASCs

Enter your SA/CASC co-funded Projects and Products on this
[spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WBFGslnaqxlbcIJ-LmH4kRvobLkH166y58UpWw03rc8/edit?usp=sharing).

Ideally enter items on the spreadsheet after having completed the co-funded
metadata requirements and published to ScienceBase. If you prefer to enter
information on this spreadsheet before completed those steps, be sure to
indicate the status of your edits/publishing in the "FWS Edits" column.

CASC data managers will refer to the spreadsheet so they know when to make edits
on their end.

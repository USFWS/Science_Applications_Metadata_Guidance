## Records fail to update to the SA Science Catalog

Occasionally, an item may seem to publish correctly to ScienceBase when if fact,
the mdJSON did not publish. ScienceBase items without mdJSON file attachments
are not in the Science Catalog. Remember that newly-published mdJSON will not be
reflected in the Science Catalog until the following day (it updates daily
overnight).

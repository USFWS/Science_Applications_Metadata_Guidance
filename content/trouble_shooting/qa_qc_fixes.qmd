## Must Do QA/QC Fixes

### Main

1. Products need to have a specific resource type selected (not “product”)
AND they need to be valid resource types. 

### Main/Citation

2. Responsible Parties need to have a valid role selected. 

### Metadata Repositories

3. Ensure you have a single version of your data.gov tag and it is consistent
across all of your items. 

4. If you update your Metadata Repositories in mdJSON and publish to
ScienceBase, you will also need to delete the erroneous version from ScienceBase
(called Harvest Sets in SB). The issue is that SB doesn’t remove tags when an
item is republished, it just adds to tags. This issue applies to all keywords,
but it is most important to fix for Harvest Sets. This scenario can happen with
both erroneous data.gov tags or misspelled Harvest Set tagging.

    You may want to consider using the [Injector Script](../appendix/injector_script/injectors_script_overview.qmd)
    to delete or replace
    erroneous versions from mdJSON. You would still be required required to 
    manually remove the erroneous versions from SB items.

### Funding

5. Additionally, all funding from other FWS programs need to list FWS as the 
source (and not list the source as Fisheries, specific Refuges, ES, etc.).
Clarifications on the exact program or refuge where the funding came from
can be done through the Funding/Other Contacts field (and choose the role of
"administrator").

6. All allocations should list the fiscal year when the funds were allocated
(this is different than a project's overall start and end dates - those are
entered in Main/Time Period). There should be only a single fiscal year
identified per allocation. Use the “Pick a Fiscal Year” dropdown to autofill the
date fields.

7. All allocation recipients should be an Organization, not an Individual
contact. Clarifications, although not required, can be done through the
Funding/Other Contacts field (e.g., list a "principalInvestigator").

### Contacts

8. All contacts need the appropriate contactType identified — this is
particularly important for funding summaries. 

### Keywords

9. Fix “Consevation design” Typo. Select correct option in mdEditor and
re-publish.

### Distribution

10. Distribution links need to be included for products. This was already
required for all products and this is particularly critical for items sent to
data.gov. This is the only online resource data.gov reads so without a URL here,
there is no way for a user to access the actual product. The recommended role is
"distributor" (see the [Product Distribution](../product_records/distribution_tab_product.qmd) section for more
info).

    **Note**: Matt Heller is looking into a solution using the injector script so 
    data managers could run this automated process themselves to meet minimum 
    requirements.

### Fixing Errors

12. Republish any records that don’t have mdJSON attached (without mdJSON,
the item will not show up in the Science Catalog).

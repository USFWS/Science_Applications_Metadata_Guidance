## Applicability

**This protocol is applicable when**: One or more regions or programs each 
contribute funding for a project and distinct sub-projects or products cannot 
be identified and attributed to any region or program.

## Metadata Responsibility

The Lead Region or Program Data Manager is responsible for project and product
metadata. There should be **only one** metadata record for each multi-regional or
programmatic project and product. These records will be searchable in the
Science Catalog for each collaborating entity identified in the metadata.

In addition to standard metadata requirements as described in 
[Project Records](../project_records/project_records_overview.qmd), 
include the  following additions.

## Main/Point of Contacts

Add the name of all funding entities as a “collaborator.”

![Example of mdEditor contact entry for FWS co-funded project](../../assets/example_contact_entry_fws_cofunded_project.png)

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
The Lead Region or Program should be listed as
**administrator** and does not need to be added again as a **collaborator**. 
:::

## Main/Abstract

Add the following text as as the last sentence:

"This \[project/product\] was a collaborative effort and co-funded by multiple
USFWS regions and/or programs: Region A, Region B, and Region C.”

-   Example: This project was a collaborative effort and co-funded by multiple
    USFWS regions: Upper Midwest Region 3 and Northeast Region 5 .
-   Example: This product was a collaborative effort and co-funded by multiple
    USFWS regions and programs: Midwest Region 3 Science Applications and
    Migratory Birds Programs.

## Metadata/Metadata Contacts

Default is **USFWS** as **publisher**. Collaborators do not need to be listed here.

## Funding (for Projects only)

Add a separate funding allocation for each year and each Region or Program that
provided funding as described in 
[Funding Tab: Project](../project_records/funding_tab_project.qmd).

1.  The source should be U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
2.  Add the funding Region or Program associated with the amount as the
    **administrator** in the Other Contacts section in mdEditor (see figure below).
3.  Each funding allocation must be entered separately for each funding Program
    or Region.

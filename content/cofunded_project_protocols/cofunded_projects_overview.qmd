There are two types of co-funded protocols.

1\) One or more region or program provides funding for a project and the project
can not be divided into distinct sub-projects to be attributed separately to any
region or program. In this case, follow the 
[FWS co-funded Projects](fws_cofunded_projects.qmd) guidance.

2\) A project is funded by a Service regional program AND by a CASC or other DOI
agency where the project can not be divided into distinct sub-projects to be
attributed separately. In this case, follow the 
[FWS/CASC Projects](fws_casc_projects_products.qmd) guidance.

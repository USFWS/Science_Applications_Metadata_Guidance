## Basic Information

### Record ID

Will be auto-generated but can be edited.

### Title

Enter as informative a title as possible. Good titles, when they appear in a
search, will be understood and/or traceable.

### Status

The **Status** drop-down menu allows you to select the status of your product.
Choose status ONLY from the four following options: *completed*, *ongoing*,
*proposed*, or *accepted*.

## Default Locale

**Default Locale** allows for the selection of **Language**, **Character Set**,
and **Country**. English, UTF-8, and USA will be selected by default, but you
may change them if necessary. See [Settings](../settings.qmd) for instruction.

![](../../assets/default_locale.png)

## Resource Types

The Resource Type must be identified when the record is created. Products must
be identified from the list of options, but 'product', while on the list, is not
a valid option. After the record is initiated the field should be automatically
filled in with the resource type selected when the record was created. Name is
optional - you can leave this blank or enter a shorten project name.

::: {.callout-info} 
Products must have a specific resource type selected, NOT just "product".

## Point of Contacts

Adding a point of contact gives staff information on who to contact should they
have a question regarding your project or product. From the **Role** drop-down
menu, select **pointOfContact**. From the **Contacts** drop-down menu, select a
contact from the list of contacts. See the [Contact Entry Guidance](../contact_entry_guidance/contact_entry_guidance_overview.qmd) section for
information on creating contacts.

| Role                  | Contact                                        | Required?               |
|:--------------------------|:--------------------------|:--------------------------|
| pointOfContact        | FWS Science Applications National Data Steward | Required                |
| pointOfContact        | Data Steward                                   | Required                |
| principalInvestigator | The Project PI                                 | Required, if applicable |
| custodian             | Data Custodian                                 | Required, if applicable |
| administrator         | Data Trustee                                   | Required                |
| administrator         | FWS Region (legacy and DOI Unified)            | Required                |
| collaborator          | partnership organizations and/or programs      | Required, if applicable |

::: {.callout-info} 
The FWS Science Applications National Data Steward will
serve as the long term contact/backup. This way, users have a point-of-contact
even if there is a positional change within an organization. Regional Data
Steward should be included in addition as a point of contact if available.

## Citation

The **Citation** lets users know pertinent information about your product such
as responsible parties, internal and ScienceBase identifiers, and any online
resources that may relate to your item. The citation much like a peer-reviewed
publication citation, provides credit and services a as reference. Adding
information in the citation will also allow users to find your item when they
search for items that contain said information.

The following fields are required in citation:

#### Title

Added automatically based on the title of your record.

#### Alternate Title

Add an alternate title.

#### Dates

Enter *acquisition*, *creation, updated*, *revision*, or *publication* date
reference from the picklist and then enter the date. At least one of these date
types is required.

#### Responsible Parties

This must include a point of contact, but may also include other responsible
parties such as funders (including your LCC), partners, collaborators, and
contributors. Collaborators could be intellectual participants while
contributors could be intellectual and financial participants.

| Role                    | Contact         | Required?     |
|:------------------------|:----------------|:--------------|
| principalInvestigator   | data creator    | Required      |
| coPrincipalInvestigator | data co-creator | Best Practice |

::: {.callout-info}
For items that will be sent to data.gov, only the first
in the list of Responsible Parties (#0) will appear. 
:::

#### Online Resource

Enter the Name and URL for the location where users can find the product (e.g.,
ScienceBase page or DOI url). Data.gov refers to this online resource link to
send users to the data download.

::: {.callout-info} 
Important: The URLs to access and download products must
**also** be included in the Distribution tab. Distribution Links is the only
online resource that data.gov reads so without a URL there, users have no way to
access the actual product from data.gov. 
:::

#### Identifier

You may enter as many identifiers as desired, but at least one is required. If
you have internal SA specific IDs for projects, enter them here. A Digital
Object Identifier (DOI) is the preferred identifier for this. The Archive Folder
Name may be included here as well.

![Example of Online resource and identifier metadata entries](../../assets/doi_identifier_metadata.png)

::: {.callout-info} 
Digital Object Identifier can be entered both as an
online resource AND an identifier. Note that the entry format is different. As
an online resource, the entire url is required, however, as an identifier, only
the prefix and suffix of the DOI are required (see figure above).
:::

::: {.callout-info title="Best Practice"} 
**Best Practice**: Create and use internal identifiers
that are unique within your region for projects and their products. Example:
GNLCC2010-11.
:::

::: {.callout-info} 
If your item does not have a ScienceBase ID (SBID) yet,
ScienceBase will create one automatically upon publishing. If you imported your
item from ScienceBase originally, then the SBID will already be included in
Metadata/Metadata Identifier and you do not need to include it here. Note that
if you edit an item that is already on ScienceBase without using its existing
SBID, a duplicate item will be created on ScienceBase. Consult the
[Publish](../publish/publish_overview.qmd) section of this manual to learn more. 
:::

::: {.callout-info} 
If the product metadata was created by copying another
mdEditor metadata record, this identifier MUST be edited/changed since it will
reflect the copied record identifier. Only the mdEditor UUID changes to
represent a new record when an item is copied. Consult the [Copy
Records](../mdeditor_metadata_file_management/copy_records.qmd) section of this 
manual to learn how to make a copy.
:::

## Description

**Description** allows for the addition of the **Abstract** as well as a Short
Abstract, Purpose, Supplemental Information, and an Environment Description.

#### Abstract

Enter an Abstract

::: {.callout-info} 
 Tip: Write your abstracts for projects in the present
tense if the project is underway and past tense if it has been completed. 
:::

#### Short Abstract

Enter a short description, limited to 300 characters, if desired. The Best
Practice here is to include a few sentences for media communications that Public
Affairs may find helpful.

#### Supplemental Information

Enter comments, if desired.

## Time Period

**Time Period** refers to project start and end date, or the date that the
product was applicable. For example, the time when a map is valid, date of
publication, date of presentation, or dates when the data was collected.

-   **Required**: For each product, add a start date and end date.

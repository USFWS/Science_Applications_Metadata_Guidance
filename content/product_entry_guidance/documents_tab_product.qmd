The **Documents** tab is where additional references to resources that *relate*
to your product but do not *define* or *describe* the item are added. These can
include videos, webinars, books, posters, web pages, news releases, etc. This
should not include links to project or products. An example document could be a
report for a workshop that inspired the product.

There are no SA specific requirements or best practices for documents.

{% hint style="info" %} ScienceBase has a similar section called "weblinks."
These will be populated in the Documents section if sbJSON is imported into
mdEditor. {% endhint %}

For more information, consult the[Documents
section](https://guide.mdeditor.org/reference/edit-window/metadata/documents-panels/document-section.html)
of the mdEditor manual.

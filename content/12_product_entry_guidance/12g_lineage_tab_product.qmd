Completing the lineage tab is recommended, but not required.

* **Statement** \(Required\): Notes actions taken to verify, transform, repair, and integrate the resource.
* **Process Step** \(Optional\): Consult the [**Process Step**](https://github.com/tpatterson1996/lcc-metadata-manual/tree/287090b07635d0e76a714278ce1f6c4aac3594cc/product-entry-guidance/lineage/process-step.md) section of this manual to learn how to add information about the creation of your project.

\[NOTE: the Publishing instructions still need some editing/refinement.\]

SA metadata is currently published to ScienceBase in your SA community's project
folder. You must have a ScienceBase user account with write access to this
folder. Once the mdJSON metadata is published in ScienceBase, the records will
be synced with the SA Science Catalog (the Science Catalog updates overnight
with new/updated mdJSON).

## Before You Begin

Please read through ALL instructions before you begin the publishing process.
After you understand how the publishing function works, please read
the [**Testing Publishing**](testing_publishing.qmd)
and proceed with testing a record before you try to publish any of your real
records.

## Overview of Publishing to the Science Catalog

The following describes what happens when you publish from mdEditor:

1.  mdEditor outputs an mdJSON file.
2.  The mdJSON file is transmitted via a web service to mdTranslator.
3.  mdTranslator translates the mdJSON file into a sbJSON file and an XML file.
4.  ScienceBase imports the sbJSON and attaches the XML and mdJSON files to the
    ScienceBase item.
5.  The record is sent to data.doi.gov and the SA Science Catalog, if the
    requisite metadata repositories are specified.

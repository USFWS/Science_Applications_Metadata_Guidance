# How to Publish

**BEST PRACTICE**: Always refresh your browser before you access the publishing
menu to ensure that you are using the most updated version of mdEditor. However,
if you have already moved items around in the publishing outline (see below for
details), note that you will lose this information if you refresh.

## **Publishing Overview**

**Step 1:** Login to ScienceBase

**Step 2:** Move Records in the Publishing Outline, as needed

**Step 3:** Submit for Publishing

**Step 4**: Review Records on ScienceBase

**Step 5**: Review Entries in the LCC Science Catalog

### Step 1: Login to ScienceBase

1.  Click the **Publish** button from the top menu in mdEditor.
2.  You will be asked to select a *publishing service*. Click on ScienceBase.
3.  A login window will appear on the right side of the screen - enter your
    ScienceBase ID and password, and click **Login**. When you are logged in,
    the login window will display who you are logged in as. *The current user
    must have read/write permissions on ScienceBase for any items to be
    published (including parent items)*. You cannot publish until you are logged
    in.

#### The mdEditor Publishing Outline:

You will see a list of every valid record in mdEditor in the publishing outline
with its ScienceBase Identifier (if the record already exists on ScienceBase)
and its parent ScienceBase Identifier (if present in the metadata). This
publishing outline shows records in a parent-child relationship and reflects
what you would see when you publish to ScienceBase.

::: {.callout-note}
Remember: Parent-Child relationships refer to how the
records are organized and displayed on ScienceBase. This is different than the
Project and Product associations identified within the metadata records. 
:::

-   Records **without parent IDs** already in their metadata will appear
    directly under the ScienceBase header in the publishing outline. These
    records will be published under the default parent identifier you
    established in the settings. The Default parent identifier is listed in the
    ScienceBase header, which is hyperlinked to the record on ScienceBase.
-   Records **with parent IDs** identified in their metadata will appear below a
    thick blue line and will be published under the parent ID listed in their
    metadata.

Items directly below the ScienceBase header will be published under the
ScienceBase item identified in your settings as “Default Parent Identifier.”
Items below the blue line will be published under the parent ID specified in the
metadata.

For example, if the *Default Parent Identifier* is your SA Community, then
projects at the *root level* in the publishing outline will be added directly
under your SA Community. Products nested under a project in the outline will be
added as a direct child item to the project item on ScienceBase. (*Note: you may
have other parent IDs identified in those records that are not loaded in
mdEditor)*

### Notes on Moving Records

You can drag and drop records to establish the parent-child relationship in the
publish outline, eliminating the need to establish that relationship in
ScienceBase. This will also allow you to move items around (e.g., move a product
from one project to another) and see that change reflected on ScienceBase.
*Remember, this only affects parent-child relationships on ScienceBase (i.e.
file structure in ScienceBase), not project-product associations.*

:::{.callout-warning}
If you do not want these parent IDs to change, **do
not** drag and drop these records in the publishing outline. 
:::

#### **General Notes on Parent IDs**:

-   If you move a product under a different project, it will update that
    product’s parent ID.
-   Parent IDs established through the relationships in the publishing outline
    will overwrite existing parent IDs in the metadata.
-   Dragging and dropping a record onto the ScienceBase header at the top will
    set that record’s parent ID to the default parent ID you identified in
    Settings.
-   If you have existing parent IDs in your metadata (and want to keep them as
    is), **do not** drag and drop those records onto the ScienceBase header--
    this will erase the existing parent ID and insert what you have set as the
    default parent identifier.

### Step 2: Move Records in the Publishing Outline

*Before you move records in the publishing outline please select your scenario
below and follow the corresponding guidance.*

#### Scenario A

*You **do not have** items on ScienceBase yet, and your desired parent-child
relationship is to have each product as a direct child of a project item on
ScienceBase:*

-   Your records will all display under the ScienceBase header in the publishing
    outline.
    -   These items will be published as a direct child item under the SB item
        identified in your settings under “Default Parent Identifier.”
-   You can **drag and drop** records in the publishing outline to establish
    parent-child relationships for ScienceBase.
-   You can **nest** items in as many levels as you desire (the most common is a
    product nested under a project).
-   To move a record back to the root level, drag and drop it on the top line
    that says “ScienceBase Default”.

#### Scenario B

*You **have** existing parent-child relationships on ScienceBase and/or you have
intermediate folder(s) between project items and products (i.e., products are
not direct child items of Project Items - this is not recommended).*

-   If you have parent-child relationships already established on ScienceBase
    (and those IDs are reflected in the mdEditor records), you likely do not
    want to move the records around in the publishing outline.
-   If your products are housed in a “Products” folder on ScienceBase (or other
    intermediate folders between the project item and the products), then your
    products **will not** be nested under projects in the publishing outline.
    -   The parent ID for those products is the “Products” folder (which would
        not have a record in mdEditor). If this is your situation, do not change
        the structure in the publishing outline and publish as is (i.e., with
        every item organized at the root level in the outline).

### Step 3: Submit for Publishing

1.  To select a record to publish, click on it and it will turn green (click
    again to un-select it).

    You cannot publish a record without a parent ID. Sending a non-existent
    parent ID to ScienceBase will return an error. If your records contain
    parent IDs in the metadata, you can choose to publish products without
    publishing their associated projects at the same time.

2.  mdEditor will publish your records sequentially, starting with the top
    record (it will publish the project first, then the products nested below
    it).

    -   If you are publishing to your *default parent identifier* or if you have
        changed any project-product relationships in the publishing outline, you
        will see the updated parent IDs appear in the outline as publishing
        occurs. If you’re publishing to the existing locations on ScienceBase,
        the IDs will not change.
    -   These new/updated IDs will be injected directly into the mdJSON file in
        mdEditor. However, these updated IDs will not be included in the mdJSON
        file that is attached to ScienceBase as part of the publishing process.
        You would have to publish the record a second time to update the mdJSON
        file attached on ScienceBase.

3.  Upon successfully publishing to ScienceBase, the third column will display a
    date and time. The record's ScienceBase ID will be displayed in the first
    column, and the Parent ID will be displayed in the second column. If there
    are any errors during publishing, they will be noted in the third column.

### Step 4: Review Records on ScienceBase

1.  Once publishing is done, refresh ScienceBase to ensure everything is showing
    up how you expected it would show up.
    -   SB items should have an mdJSON and XML file attached
    -   SB items should be in the location reflected in the mdEditor publishing
        outline
2.  You can re-publish records as needed (e.g., after updating or correcting
    metadata).

### Step 5: Review Entries in the SA Science Catalog

The Science Catalog updates overnight so you should review newly-published
records the day after you publish to ScienceBase. This will be one of your best
quality control checks.

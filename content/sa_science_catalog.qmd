# SA Science Catalog

A more detailed look at the metadata requirements and architecture behind the 
Science Applications Science Catalog.

## Overview

The SA Science Catalog collates the metadata from all FWS regions and 
Headquarters. It allows for user-defined searching and filtering of projects 
and products as well as access to products for download. Users can see what has 
been funded, which can help prevent duplication of work. The SA Science Catalog 
also enables reporting, such as funding summaries or project examples based on 
particular geographies, species, organization, year, or other categories of 
interest.

## Architecture \[editing in progress\]

At present, SA creates and edits metadata in mdEditor and then publish the 
metadata to ScienceBase, where it can be channeled to the SA Science Catalog 
and data.gov. The mdTranslator tool is integrated with mdEditor so you can 
create metadata once, and then convert and publish the metadata in your desired 
format, such as mdJSON for the SA Science Catalog, sbJSON for ScienceBase, XML 
for data.gov, and FGDC for geospatial data.

1.  Items are imported from a database (like ScienceBase), or created directly 
in mdEditor.
2.  mdJSON files can also be stored in a local repository and then transmitted 
via a web service to ScienceBase. Alternately, the local files can be exported 
to a web accessible folder and then harvested by ScienceBase.
3.  The mdTranslator converts the mdJSON files into sbJSON (the ScienceBase 
JSON format), and XML.
4.  Items are exported from ScienceBase to: Data.gov as XML; the SA Science 
Catalog website as Projects and Products; or into mdEditor as mdJSON.

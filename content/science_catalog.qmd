A more detailed look at the metadata requirements and architecture behind the
Science Applications Science Catalog.

## Overview

The SA Science Catalog collates the metadata from all FWS regions and
Headquarters. It allows for user-defined searching and filtering of projects and
products as well as access to products for download. Users can see what has been
funded, which can help prevent duplication of work. The SA Science Catalog also
enables reporting, such as funding summaries or project examples based on
particular geographies, species, organization, year, or other categories of
interest.

## Architecture

At present, SA creates and edits metadata in mdEditor and then publish the
metadata to ScienceBase, where it can be channeled to the SA Science Catalog and
Data.gov. The mdTranslator tool is integrated with mdEditor so you can create
metadata once, and then convert and publish the metadata in your desired format,
such as mdJSON for the SA Science Catalog, sbJSON for ScienceBase, XML for
data.gov, and FGDC for geospatial data.

1.  Items are imported from a database (like ScienceBase), or created directly
    in mdEditor.
2.  mdJSON files can also be stored in a local repository and then transmitted
    via a web service to ScienceBase. Alternately, the local files can be
    exported to a web accessible folder and then harvested by ScienceBase.
3.  The mdTranslator converts the mdJSON files into sbJSON (the ScienceBase JSON
    format), and XML.
4.  Items are exported from ScienceBase to: Data.gov as XML; the SA Science
    Catalog website as Projects and Products; or into mdEditor as mdJSON.

Blue arrow action are performed by the user. After a user publishes to ScienceBase from mdEditor, the dark brown arrow actions are triggered automatically by mdEditor and ScienceBase webservices. Green arrow actions are performed automatically by the external catalogs.](/assets/metadata_system_architecture2.png){width="800"}

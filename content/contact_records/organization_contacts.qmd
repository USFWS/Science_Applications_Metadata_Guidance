## Create a New Contact

1.  Click the plus (![](../../assets/symbol_plus_16.png)) sign by
    **Contacts**.
2.  Specify the contact is an **Organization**.
3.  The **Contact ID** will be auto-generated by mdEditor.

*The following fields are available for **Organization Contacts**

-   **Organization Name** ([Required]`r req_style`): The organization's full name; avoid
    acronyms (however, abbreviating United States as U.S. is acceptable.
    Example: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service).
-   **Contact Type** ([Required]`r req_style`): Enter the contact type from the picklist. Make
    sure every contact has Contact Type selected - this is essential for the
    Science Catalog funding summaries.
-   **Email Address** ([Required]`r req_style`): Add an email address of the primary
    contact in the organization.
-   **Online Resource** ([Required]`r req_style`): Add a web URL where the organization
    resides. Online resource may also include social networks.
-   **Physical Address** ([Best Practice]`r best_style`): Enter a physical address
-   **Logo** ([Optional]`r other_style`):
    -   You can either select or drop an image. If you choose to load an image,
        mdEditor will create a URI and will have a size limit for the logo. If
        you have a larger image, link to it rather than loading it into
        mdEditor.
    -   If an organization has a logo associated with it, individuals will
        inherit the logos from the organization.

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
If you upload a logo to your contact record, you must include a filename for 
the logo. Otherwise, an error will occur in the metadata records that include 
that contact.

Contacts**](https://adiwg.gitbooks.io/mdeditor/content/contact/new/organization.html)
section of the mdEditor manual.

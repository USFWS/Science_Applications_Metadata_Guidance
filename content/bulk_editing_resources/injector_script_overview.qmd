## mdEditor Injector Script

Link: <https://github.com/mmheller/mdEditorFileInjector>

Purpose: to perform bulk edits to mdEditor files by injecting, replacing, or
deleting mdJSON content. mdEditor files are files exported from the mdEditor web
application (mdeditor.org). More information on mdJSON can be found at
<https://github.com/adiwg/mdJson-schemas>

There are two demos available to help with metadata improvements:

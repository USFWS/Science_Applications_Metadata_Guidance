## Auto-Save

A feature in mdEditor settings that allows information to be automatically saved
as it is entered. Consult the [**Settings**](settings.qmd) section of this manual
for more information.

## Customization

The ability afforded by open-source code to edit the code of an application (in
this case mdEditor) according to the needs of the users.

## FGDC

Federal Geographic Data Committee <https://www.fgdc.gov/>

## FGDC CSDGM

Federal Geographic Data Committee’s Content Standard for Digital Geospatial
Metadata - FGDC-STD-001-1998 Includes Biological Data Profile
<https://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/csdgm/>

## HTML

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the standard markup language
for creating Web pages. HTML is the ‘human-readable’ and printable report of the
metadata content

## ISO

International Organization for Standardization - ISO is an independent,
non-governmental international organization with a membership of 162 [national
standards bodies](https://www.iso.org/members.html).

Through its members, it brings together experts to share knowledge and develop
voluntary, consensus-based, market relevant International Standards that support
innovation and provide solutions to global challenges.

## ISO 19110

International Standards Organization Geographic Information - Feature Catalogue
19110:2005

ISO 19110 defines the methodology for cataloguing feature types. It may be used
as a basis for defining the universe of discourse being modelled in a particular
application, or to standardize general aspects of real world features being
modelled in more than one application. (International Organization for
Standardization (2016). **ISO 19110:2016**. Retrieved from:
<https://www.iso.org/standard/57303.html>)

## ISO 19115-1

Defines the schema required for describing geographic information and services
by means of metadata. It provides information about the identification, the
extent, the quality, the spatial and temporal aspects, the content, the spatial
reference, the portrayal, distribution, and other properties of digital
geographic data and services. (International Organization for Standardization
(2014). **ISO 19115-1:2014**. Retrieved from:
<https://www.iso.org/standard/53798.html>)

## ISO 19115-2

International Standards Organization Geographic Information - Metadata
19115-2:2009

Extends the existing geographic metadata standard by defining the schema
required for describing imagery and gridded data. It provides information about
the properties of the measuring equipment used to acquire the data, the geometry
of the measuring process employed by the equipment, and the production process
used to digitize the raw data. This extension deals with metadata needed to
describe the derivation of geographic information from raw data, including the
properties of the measuring system, and the numerical methods and computational
procedures used in the derivation. The metadata required to address coverage
data in general is addressed sufficiently in the general part of ISO 19115.

## JSON

Javascript Object Notation, a general purpose format like CSV.

## Keywords

Words used in an information retrieval system to indicate the content of a
document.

## localStorage Cache

localStorage Cache allows an application to store data locally, in a user's
browser. Storing information on the browser's local storage cache (instead of a
normal file cache) means that if you use a different browser to access the
mdEditor, it will not show the data you've imported from your first browser. It
also means that if you clear your browser's cache, it will generally not clear
your mdEditor records. However, depending upon your browser settings (E.g., in
Chrome, if the "**cookies and other site data**" option is checked), clearing
your browser cache may still clear your mdEditor data.

## mdEditor

Web application for authoring and editing metadata, for both projects and
datasets.

## mdEditor File

A mdJSON file created by mdEditor that contains all of the information contained
in mdJSON, along with mdEditor settings. This can be exported and shared with
collaborators, imported into another record set, or saved to a local workstation
as a backup or archival copy.

## mdJSON

ADIwg standard for encoding project and data metadata, based on JavaScript
Object Notation (JSON).

## mdJSON File

An mdJSON file that is proprietary to the Metadata toolkit developed by the
Alaska Data Integration Working Group (ADIWG), learn more at
\[[https://adiwg.github.io/mdTools/](https://www.gitbook.com/book/adiwg/mdeditor/edit#)\].

## mdTranslator

Open-source Ruby software application for translating between metadata
standards. Metadata is input in one of the supported ‘reader’ formats and output
in one of the supported ‘writer’ formats. Available as Ruby gem or
Command-Line-Interface.

## Metadata

Metadata is a set of data that describes and gives information about other data.

## Metadata Repositories

A server where metadata is published to.

## ParentID

Identifier for a folder on a database where records will be stored upon
publishing.

## sbJSON

U.S. Geological Survey’s standard for documenting records ingested into
ScienceBase Catalog. The format used to define the attributes of ScienceBase
items.

## ScienceBase

A USGS collaborative scientific data and information management platform used
directly by science teams. ScienceBase provides access to aggregated information
derived from many data and information domains, including feeds from existing
data systems, metadata catalogs, and scientists contributing new and original
content. ScienceBase architecture is designed to help science teams and data
practitioners centralize their data and information resources to create a
foundation needed for their work. ScienceBase, both original software and
engineered components, is released as an open source project to promote
involvement from the larger scientific programming community both inside and
outside the USGS. (USGS (2018). *About ScienceBase.* Retrived from:
<https://www.sciencebase.gov/about/content/about-sciencebase>).

## URI

Uniform Resource Identifier is a string of characters used to identify a
resource. A URL is a type of URI.

Follow this workflow if you have already created and published mdJSON to
ScienceBase and need to update the metadata and re-publish to ScienceBase.

## **Step 1: Gather information needed for your metadata entries.**

Have the necessary information to update your metadata records readily
accessible before you begin.

## Step 2: Open mdEditor.

The direct link to mdEditor is <https://go.mdeditor.org>. Choose the browser you
plan to use for mdEditor and bookmark this link.

mdEditor can also be accessed from its homepage at <https://www.mdeditor.org/>.
This site provides some background information and Frequently Asked Questions
about mdEditor.

## Step 3: [Import](../mdeditor_metadata_file_management/import_mdjson.qmd) mdEditor file(s).

Import the mdEditor file(s) that you wish to edit. Remember, once you have
edited and published metadata from mdEditor, you must always use mdEditor to
update the metadata (rather than make changes directly on ScienceBase). The
Science Catalog will only update based on what is in mdJSON (and not sbJSON).

## Step 4: Check the [Settings](../settings.qmd).

Ensure the correct LCC-specific settings are in place for Importing, Metadata
Repositories, and Publishing.

## Step 5: Update [Contacts](../contact_entry_guidance/contact_entry_guidance_overview.qmd).

If you have new contacts to add to your metadata record, create those contacts.

## Step 6: Update [Projects](../project_entry_guidance/overview_project.qmd).

Update/edit metadata as needed.

## Step 7: Update [Products](../product_entry_guidance/overview_product.qmd).

Update/edit metadata as needed.

## Step 8: For applicable Products, create, import, or update Data [Dictionaries](../product_entry_guidance/dictionaries_tab_product.qmd).

## Step 9: Check Associations between Projects and/or Products.

If you only updated metadata in existing record that were already associated,
you do not need to do anything with the associations.

If you created a new product for your project, then associate those records in
mdEditor.

## Step 10: [Publish](../publish/publish_overview.qmd) your records to ScienceBase.

Check that your record published where expected and that the mdJSON and xml
files are attached to the SB Item. Your records should publish to their existing
locations. If you added a new product to a project, then it should appear as a
new child item to the project.

## Step 11: [Export](../mdeditor_metadata_file_management/export.qmd) 
your records and contacts for backup, transfer, or sharing.

You may want to export working backups before publishing depending on your
situation, but archival exports should be done after publishing since publishing
can alter records, like adding or changing a ScienceBase ID.

## Step 12: Review the resulting entries in the [Science Catalog](https://www.fws.gov/science/catalog).

The Science Catalog updates overnight so you should review newly-published
records the day after you publish to ScienceBase. This will be one of your best
quality control checks.

## Step 13: Consult with the different [QA/QC Resources](../trouble_shooting_tips/qa_qc_resources.qmd).

See the [QA/QC Resources](../trouble_shooting_tips/qa_qc_fixes.qmd) page for
the different tools available to check your metadata.

## Create a New Contact

1.  Click the plus (![](../.gitbook/assets/symbol_plus_16.png)) sign by
    **Contacts**.
2.  Specify the contact is an **Individual**.
3.  The **Contact ID** will be auto-generated by mdEditor.

*The following fields are available for **Individual Contacts:***

-   **Individual Name** (Required): Enter individual's full name If you are
    entering a generic Individual contact, you can enter a Position Name without
    entering an Individual Name. For example: you could enter Region 3 Data
    Manager as a Position Name rather than an Individual Name.
-   **Position Name**: Enter individual's full title; avoid acronyms If you have
    entered the individual's name, Position Name is not required.
-   **Contact Type** (Required): Enter the contact type from the picklist. Make
    sure that every contact has Contact Type selected - this is essential for
    the Science Catalog funding summaries.
-   **Member Organization** (Required): Select organization(s). An individual
    may be part of multiple organizations.
-   **Email Address** (Required): Enter individual's email
-   **Physical Address** (Best Practice): Enter a physical address
-   **Logo** (Optional):
    -   It is uncommon that you would add a logo for an individual. If the
        individual is part of an organization, the individual will inherit the
        logo from the organization.
    -   You can either select or drop-in an image. If you choose to load an
        image, mdEditor will create a URI and has a size limit for the logo. If
        you have a larger image, link to the image rather than loading it into
        mdEditor.

::: {.callout-warning} 
If you upload a logo to your contact record, you must
include a filename for the logo. Otherwise, mdEditor will indicate an error on
the metadata records that includes this contact.

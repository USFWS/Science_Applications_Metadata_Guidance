### Central storage of mdEditor Files

All mdEditor files (NOT just the mdJSON files) need to be in a central location
accessible to the DMWG and SA Headquarters as well as the respective regional
personnel. These are needed to ensure future updates, corrections, or
improvements can be made to any metadata record. During the 2017 Seattle
workshop, the ASG proposes that everyone post their mdEditor files to the single
ScienceBase folder.

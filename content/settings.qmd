The settings menu allows for the configuring of user-specific options. Settings
must be configured before you create SA metadata.

## General Settings

**mdEditor Version**: The mdEditor version notes the current version of
mdEditor. Use this when reporting errors. Errors can be reported at
<https://github.com/adiwg/mdEditor/issues>. You must have a github account in
order to post.

**Auto-Save**: The Auto-Save option will write all changes to local storage when
you exit a data entry field. Changes must be manually saved if the Auto-Save
feature is turned off.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
Auto-Save allows you to save less frequently, but it makes it harder to undo
changes that you make to your records. If you stay on the same record, you can
cancel changes. But once you leave the record, the record is saved and you can’t
cancel the change except by manually re-editing the record.
:::

**Copy in Edit Mode:** All

**Delete in Edit Mode:** Allow users to delete a record while in edit

**Clear All Records**: All records can be cleared by clicking the "Clear Storage
Cache."

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
**Warning**: Clearing all records will delete all of the records currently
loaded in mdEditor. Before doing so, use the Export function to make a backup of
your records. Otherwise, the records will be permanently lost (unless you
previously made a backup copy).

## SA-Specific Settings

*These must be implemented before you begin creating metadata records.*

**1. Importing from ScienceBase** In the Defaults section, set the default
Import URL to import items from ScienceBase with the following:
<https://api.sciencebase.gov/sbmd-service/mdjson/>.

**2. MdTranslator** In the Defaults section, set the default
mdTranslator API URL to use the latest version of the translator with the 
following:
<https://api.sciencebase.gov/mdTranslator/api/v3/translator>.

**3. Metadata Repositories**: In the Defaults section, add two Metadata
Repositories.

1.  Select **ScienceCatalog** from the Repository drop-down menu. Enter “SA
    Science Catalog” as the collection title. It is important that the text is
    entered exactly as written to be included in the Science Catalog.
2.  Select **data.gov** from the Repository drop-down menu. For the collection
    title, enter "Data.gov USFWS Science Applications".

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
The metadata repository information must be exactly the same for each record
with no variations in spelling, spaces, capitalization, etc. Specifying this
information in Settings is the best way to ensure the repository information
will be consistent across records. It is strongly recommended that you do not
type these in by hand on individual metadata records.
:::

**3. Parent Identifier**: Under publishing, enter the ScienceBase identifier for
your SA Region's ScienceBase project folder (see table below) in the "Default
Parent Identifier" field.

| USFWS Region     | Parent Identifier        |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| **Region 1**     | 5b4e1c5ae4b06a6dd17df2d5 |
| **Region 2**     | 5b6469d3e4b006a11f733900 |
| **Region 3**     | 5b6469e5e4b006a11f733902 |
| **Region 4**     | 5b6469efe4b006a11f733904 |
| **Region 5**     | 5b6469f8e4b006a11f733906 |
| **Region 6**     | 5b646a02e4b006a11f733908 |
| **Region 7**     | 5b646a2fe4b006a11f73390c |
| **Region 8**     | 5b646a38e4b006a11f73390e |
| **Headquarters** | 5b646a14e4b006a11f73390a |

## Defaults

**Defaults** include settings for **Language**, **Character Set**, **Country**,
and the *\*Import URL* \*(used for defining the default URL for importing).

The following defaults will be pre-loaded:

-   default language: English
-   default character set: UTF-8
-   default location: USA

Also included in **Defaults** are the **Metadata Repositories** (online
databases for storing metadata). Once entered in **Settings** these can then be
selected for projects and products so that they are flagged to a metadata
repository of your choice. See SA Specific Settings for Metadata Repository
information above.

## Publishing Settings

SA metadata will be published directly to ScienceBase (and from there be sent to
the Science Catalog and data.gov).

In the **Default Parent Identifier**, enter your SA Region's ScienceBase project
folder ScienceBase ID (SBID). **Default Community** and **Default Organization**
are free text fields to describe where your Default Parent Identifier is
located.

## Export Settings

See the [Export section](metadata_file_management/export.qmd#export-options) for
information about the options available for Exporting.

## Profile and Validation Settings

Allows a user to import a custom metadata profile and/or a custom validation
schema.

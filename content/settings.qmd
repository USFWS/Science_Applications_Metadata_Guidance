The **Settings** menu allows for the configuring of user-specific options. 
Settings must be configured before you create SA metadata.

The **mdEditor Version** notes the current version of
mdEditor. Use this when reporting errors. Errors can be reported at
<https://github.com/adiwg/mdEditor/issues>. You must have a github account in
order to post.

## General Settings

The **Auto-Save** option will automatically write all changes to local storage 
when you exit a data entry field when turned on. If the Auto-Save
feature is turned off, changes must be manually saved. Auto-Save allows you to 
save less frequently, but it makes it harder to undo
changes that you make to your records. If you stay on the same record, you can
cancel changes. But once you leave the record, the record is saved and you can’t
cancel the change except by manually re-editing the record.

The **Copy in Edit Mode** option allow users to copy a record while in edit mode.

The **Delete in Edit Mode** option allows users to delete a record while in edit mode.

The **Clear All Records** option will delete all records (Projects, Products, 
and Contacts) by clicking the "Clear Storage Cache" button.

::: {.callout-warning}
Clearing all records will delete all of the records currently
loaded in mdEditor. Before doing so, use the Export function to make a backup of
your records. Otherwise, the records will be permanently lost (unless you
previously made a backup copy).

## Defaults

These **<u>must be implemented</u>** before you begin creating metadata records. 
These defaults will allow metadata to be imported from ScienceBase, connect to 
the proper version of mdTranslator, and select the proper metadata repositories. 

Keep the **Language** defaults that are pre-loaded. Language: **English**, 
Character Set: **UTF-8**, Location: **USA**.

Set the **Import URL** to: <https://api.sciencebase.gov/sbmd-service/mdjson/>

Set the **mdTranslator API URL** to:
<https://api.sciencebase.gov/mdTranslator/api/v3/translator>

For the **Metadata Repositories** (online databases for storing metadata) 
settings, add two repositories:

1.  Select **ScienceCatalog** from the Repository drop-down menu. Enter 
    “**SA Science Catalog**” as the collection title. It is important that the 
    text is entered exactly as written to be included in the Science Catalog.
2.  Select **data.gov** from the Repository drop-down menu. For the collection
    title, enter "**Data.gov USFWS Science Applications**".

Once entered in the Settings, these repository options can then be selected for 
projects and products records to ensure they are properly tag for inclusion in 
the repositories. 

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
The metadata repository information must be exactly the same for each record
with no variations in spelling, spaces, capitalization, etc. Specifying this
information in Settings is the best way to ensure the repository information
will be consistent across records. It is strongly recommended that you do not
type these in by hand on individual metadata records.

## Publishing Settings

Under **Publishing Settings**, in the **Default Parent Identifier** field, 
enter the ScienceBase identifier (SBID) for your SA Region.

The following table shows each Region's **Default Parent Identifier**. This is 
the ScienceBase identifier for each Region's 'Project' folder.

Examples: “product webpage” or “Product Webpage with Downloadable Files.” If there are multiple files for a single product record, the Name should be different for each file so the user can differentiate between them. For example, “Download Aguiguan Veg 2016 data” or “Download FDM Veg 2011 data.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nUnique Names for multiple files are particularly important for items being sent to data.gov. Without a name specified at all, the link will display as “webpage,” which isn’t particularly informative to users.

Preferably the link should be a direct download to the data and not an intermediary page.\n\n\n\n\nFunction\nIn the Function field, you should indicate the type of URL. If the link is a direct download of the data, select “download.” If the link goes to an informational page, select “information.”\n\n\nHow to obtain download link from ScienceBase Items\nFor products hosted on ScienceBase, obtaining the direct download URL is a little tricky. The text displayed on the ScienceBase page under Attached Files is not actually a link (so you can’t right-click and copy link address from there). Here are directions for how to obtain the direct download link for ScienceBase items.\n(1) First scroll to the Attached Files on the ScienceBase item and click the Attach Files control.\n\n(2) From the list of attached files, find the relevant file, right click the name, and select “copy link address.” Then paste that link into the Online Option in mdEditor.\n\n\n\n\nOffline Option\nIf your product is only available offline, describe how users can obtain the product here.",

Follow the specific steps below to write each line.\n\n\nEnter the path to the Demo folder in line –C. Note: all files and files in subfolders will be processed by the script. No original files will be edited, copies will always be made.\n\n\n\nEnter “metadata|funding” in line –D. This is the location in the JSON that we’re telling the script to look for finding JSON text. Note: be sure to add double quotes for this argument.\nFor line –F\n\n\n\nCopy/paste the path to the unzipped folder with all the injector script files.\nAND copy/paste the file name inject_FundingAdministrator.txt\n\n\n\nMake sure to separate the path and filename with a back slash. This holds all the text we will inject.\n\nFor line –f, do the same thing but with the file name find_FundingAdminstrator.txt. This holds all the text the script uses to find text to replace.\nAdd False to the –T line. This indicates we’re not adding new contacts to the available contacts list.\nAdd 6 to the –O line. This specifies the option for the more complex find/replace.\n\n\n\n\n(4) Edit the inject_FundingAdministrator.txt file with the Contact ID of your choice.\n\nOpen mdEditor, clear the cache, and then import one of the mdEditor files from the demo folder.\nHowever you want to do it, copy the Contact ID of your choice.\n\n\n\nOpen inject_FundingAdministrator.txt in a text editor and overwrite the Contact ID value in the file. Save and then close the file.\n\n\n{% hint style=“info” %} Note: The Contact ID you enter must be the same for all the mdEditor files you want to run through the processor (or are in the demo folder). If you have different Contact IDs to inject across different records, you must do these in separate iterations of the script with only the relevant mdEditor files for each contact ID. If you have different Contact IDs to add within the same record, you cannot use the script and must edit those records manually in mdEditor. {% endhint %}\n\n\n(5) Open the find_FundingAdminstrator.txt file.\nMake sure it says:\n\n\n\n(6) Inspect one or more of the mdEditor files in mdEditor.\n\nGo to Funding. Choose an allocation where match is not selected and click “More.” Then click “Edit” for the allocation. Scroll down and notice no entries under “Other Contacts.”\n\n\n\n\n(7) Run the script.\n\nBack in the text editor, add two blank lines in the beginning.\n\n\n\nFind the path to your python.exe and enter in the 1st line. Example: C:.exe\nFind the path to your .py injector script file and enter in the 2nd line. Note: this will be in the folder you downloaded and unzipped. Example: C:-master_v1.py\n\n\n\nRemove all the carriage returns and extra spaces, and save if desired. Note: if any of your file paths have spaces, make sure to enclose the full path/filename with double quotes.\n\n\n\nOpen a DOS prompt.\n\n\n\nCopy/paste the text from your text editor into the command prompt to run.\n\n\n\n\n(8) Inspect the results.\n\nOpen mdEditor and clear the cache.\nClick Import. Go to the demo folder and into the new folder created. Note: each time the process runs it will create a new folder and add new files to this folder.\n\n\n\nSelect one of the new files to import.\nGo to Funding. Choose an allocation where match is not selected and click “More.” Then click “Edit” for the allocation. Scroll down and notice a new entry under “Other Contacts.”\n\n\nNote: If it errors out, there’s a problem. Go to the demo folder and into the new folder created and do the following:\n\nNote the filename that is a problem\nRemove the file from the demo folder\nDelete the new folder and files created from the last run\nRerun",

This exports an mdEditor file containing all records and contacts currently loaded in mdEditor.\nWhen exporting products or projects, you should also export your entire contact list. If you do not export your contact list, and you later import a record that contains a contact not in your mdEditor library, you may receive an error and have to re-create and re-enter the contact to that record.\nIt is particularly important that you export your records for backup before using mdEditor’s Clear Storage Cache functionality (clearing the storage cache will delete any records or data you have entered into the mdEditor). Exporting ensures that your data is secure even after clearing the storage cache. Not exporting your data before clearing your cache will result in a permanent loss of records.

    "section": "",
    "text": "A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a globally unique, persistent, and resolvable identifier used to uniquely identify objects and are widely used to identify academic, professional, and government information (e.g., journal articles, research reports, data sets, official publications). Think of it as a Social Security Number for your data. DOIs are standardized by the International Organization of Standards (ISO). DOIs are connected to the asset in perpetuity through a DOI hosting service (e.g., DataCite or CrossRef) that maintains the link to the resource.\nDOIs should be assigned to Service-funded assets such as dataset, services, models, and reports, with the exception of research publications where journals assign the DOIs. Using DOIs promotes discovery and re-useability of the Service’s work and investments in data and ensures appropriate recognition for those collecting and properly managing data assets.\nFor more information on DOIs, see Digital Object Identifier Handbook.\nThe Service Digital Object Identifier Management Tool enables Service personnel to assign DOIs, registered with DataCite, to Service-funded data products and other resources. This tool is used to mint (create), update, publish, administer, and search for Service DOIs. DOI required metadata includes the asset title, creator(s), publication date, type of data product, abstract, dates relevant to the resource, and an online link to the permanent repository location of resource and can be updated at any time.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Anatomy of a DOI URL\n\n\nFigure 1 from Alaska Region Interim Data Management User Guide\nOnce minted, the DOI is included as an identifier in your metadata record (Figure 2)\n\nThis Tool was developed and is managed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Science Analytics and Synthesis (SAS) Science Data Management Branch, under an interagency agreement with the Service.\nDOIs generated by this tool should be assigned to Service-funded data products (such as data releases, services, models, and reports), with the exception of primary research publications published in one of the Service’s journals which are assigned through a process governed by the National Conservation Training Center. To generate data product DOIs, you need to submit brief citation metadata, including the title, creator(s), publication date, type of data product, abstract, dates relevant to the data, and an online link to the data. These citation metadata can be updated at any time.\nBefore you being, collect required metadata information as follows:\n\n\n\nMetadata\nRequired?\n\n\n\n\nTitle\nRequired\n\n\nResource Type\nRequired\n\n\nPoint of Contact\nRequired\n\n\nDate\nRequired\n\n\nAbstract\nRequired\n\n\nRepository URL\nRequired\n\n\n\n\nCreating and maintaining a DOI\nThe DOI Tool is designed to be user friendly and guide you through the process to mint, populate metadata, publish, and administer DOIs. It is important to note that there is both a “beta” and “live” version of the DOI. The beta version is useful as a training resource to become familiar with the DOI Tool.. The live version is where you go to actually create a DOI, which can be set to hidden or public. DOIs assigned through the live version have a prefix of 10.7944.\nTo login to the DOI Tool:\n\nUse your Service email address and password. Once logged in, you will have “read-only” access to any record, “write” access to records that you created and to those where you have been added as a “Manager”.\n\n\nMinting a DOI\nMinting a DOI creates and reserves a DOI and DOI URL and does NOT require fully populated metadata fields. The benefit to minting the DOI early, such as in the Planning or Access Phase of the data lifecycle is efficiency. The DOI can be referencing in related documentation, metadata, and other elements of the project, reducing the need for updating later.\nTo mint a DOI, follow these steps:\n\nEnter our existing metadata into the DOI Tool following the instructions provided on the site. New users are encouraged to review the “NEW USER?” section in the login page (Figure 1). The DOI does not need to be published publicly until the DOI metadata is completed.\n\n\n\n\nNew User Instructions on the Login Page\n\n\nThe DOI is comprised of the resolvable service url, the registered prefix and a product identifier suffix (Figure 2). Service DOI are assigned the prefix of 10.7964. The DOI URL can be used as a weblink to the registered asset.\n\nOnce created, the DOI is ready for use asset related metadata, reports, publications, and other elements that need to refer to DOIs as soon as necessary.\nDuring the maintain phase of the data lifecycle, any empty fields in the DOI metadata should be updated.\nOnce the fields in the DOI metadata are fully populated, publish the DOI. This creates the digital tether to the URL for the data resource landing page.\nYou can administer the DOI at any time using the DOI tools dashboard(s). See the DOI Administration section below for more information.\nInclude the DOI as an identifier in your metadata record (Figure 2b). As an identifier, only the prefix and suffix are needed.\nInclude the DOI as an online resource in your metadata record (Figure 2c). In this case the entire DOI url is needed.\n\n\n\n\nINCORRECT DOI entry as identifier in metadata\n\n\n\n\n\nCORRECT DOI entry as identifier in metadata\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of DOI entered as both online resource and identifier\n\n\n\n\n\nDOI Administration\nThe Service has secured a large, yet limited bank (range) of DOIs. Once minted, the DOI is valid in perpetuity. If you are new to the DOI, please get familiar with the tool in the training beta version. When ready to officially reserve a DOI, use the live version of the tool. The DOI tool was not intended to be used do not for data assets that were not initiated, funded, or delivered as part of a Service project.\nTo date the Service has not identified a responsible party or governance for administering DOIs within the Service. As a result, the duties of DOI administration must fall to the collective of Service DOI creators/editors. DOI administration duties include:\nEnsuring minted DOIs are being used for their intended purpose, which includes:\n\nMinimizing the number of DOIs being minted and never published,\n\nEnsuring one DOI per digital object (e.g. research reports, data sets, service, etc.)\nEnsuring URL paths are still resolvable (no broken web links attached to the DOI)\n\nProviding usage reports\nHelping to reconcile previous DOIs from other DOI services\nEnhancing supplemental DOI metadata\n\nEach Service program, currently without enterprise level governance, has the option to administer the assignment of DOIs to their data assets within their program such that it meets their workflow. While the tool is available for any Service employee to login and create a DOI, a program may prefer to have a process to trigger a review or notification before a DOI is created. For example, an employee may login and create a DOI during planning set the DOI to hidden until the data and set edit rights to other accountable data staff. Once completed and approved, the DOI status can be set to public.\n\n\n\nExample of DOI Tool Dashboard\n\n\n\n\nBulk DOI Creation and Updates API\nThis tool also has an optional Web API (application programming interface) component for the automated creation and editing of DOIs and may be useful for bulk creation of DOIs through scripting/programming. After logging into the tool with your Department of Interior Active Directory credentials, see the DOI API link for more information.\n\n\n\nDOI API tool link indicated with red arrow",

Science Catalog users can search by specific fiscal year, funders, or recipients.\nA funding allocation represents a single fiscal year, source, and recipient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you have two recipients in a single fiscal year, each needs to be added as separate funding allocations.\n\n\n\nRequired Fields\nFor each funding allocation, the following fields should be filled out.\n\nAward ID (Required)\nThe Award ID numbers are internal codes that connect the distribution forms to the project metadata. Award IDs include grant or cooperative agreement numbers, contract numbers, or inter-agency agreement numbers. Inclusion of Award IDs provides accountability and allows tracking and auditing between financial systems and the Science Catalog.\nIf no Award ID exists, then the project is likely an internal effort. Enter ’None” in the Award ID field. This allows for tracking and search of internally funded projects.\n\n\nAmount (Required)\nEnter the amount of funding. Be sure U.S. Dollars is selected (ie. Unites States of America, the–US Dollar; this is third from the bottom of USD options in mdEditor).\n\n\nSource (Required)\nAdd the relevant contact for the “source” of the project funding. Source should be an organization, not an individual. For SA projects, the most common sources are U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, and Bureau of Reclamation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFunding source should always identify the agency or organization, rather than a sub-program or office. For example, all funding from other FWS programs need to list U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as the source (and not list the source as Fisheries, specific Refuges, ES, etc.). Clarifications on the exact program or office where the funding came from should be done through the Funding/Other Contacts field.\n\n\n\n\nRecipient (Required)\nAdd the relevant contact for the “recipient” of the project funding. Recipient should always be an organization, not an individual. For example, the Principal Investigator would not be listed as the recipient, but their organization would be. If there are multiple recipients for a project, they need to be added as separate allocations.\nYou could add the Principal Investigator in the Other Contacts field as “principalInvestigator.”\n\n\nOther Contacts (Required)\nIn most cases, a program or region has allocated the funding for a project. In order to track funds within regions and programs and provide proper credit, add the FWS region (yes, both the legacy region and the DOI unified region for now) as the funding “administrator” for all allocations. Recall that the funding source should identify the agency who supplied the funding (i.e. US Fish and Wildlife Service). Also, add the program name, if applicable, as the funding “administrator”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFunding administrator can also be used to differentiate funding from different programs/offices within the same agency. For example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service can be identified as the funding source and the funding administrator may also include “Ecological Services” or a specific field office.\n\n\n\n\nMarked Funding\nIn some cases, funds are marked for specific activities and include reporting requirements that accompany the funding allocations. For example, EPA allocates Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) funds on behalf of Congress to FWS, among others. FWS then distributes the funds across programs for use. The Gulf Coast Restore funds are a similar case. This funding flow can be tracked and aggregated with the Funding Other Contacts. Add the Name of the funding source as an organization contact and add the funding source as the “funder” in Funding Other Contacts.\n\n\n\nExample of organizational fund contact entry\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of organizational fund entry in Funding metadata entry\n\n\n\n\nFWS sub-activity, funding codes, agreement type (Best Practice)\nIn order to better integrate budgeting records and align with activity tracking priorities, add the FWS sub-activity code and funding code in the Allocation comments. Also add the funding For example, the text entry may look like this: FWS sub-activity 1420, fundcode 190, contract. If funds are provided from multiple sub-activities, please add this in the description (i.e. FWS sub-activity 1430, fundcode 170, $30,000: sub-activity 1420, fundcode 170, $10,000). At some point in the future, mdEditor may include additional fields for these values.\n\n\n\nExample budgeting information in Allocation Description\n\n\n\n\nMatching and In-kind Funds\nProject funds or in-kind support that were supplied by a partner (i.e., not specifically allocated to SA) should be included as an allocation as described above, but with the matching fund box checked. Each matching fund provider needs to be included as a separate allocation.\n\n\n\nExample of Matching Allocation Metadata entry",

Recommend you create only simple polygons or bounding boxes. If you want greater detail, attach high-definition shapefiles instead of trying to draw them.\nExtents should be accurate enough for searching purposes, but remember that they are metadata, not data.\n\nOption 1: Import Spatial Features\nSpatial features such as geoJSON, shapefiles, and kml can be imported. However, file attributes (such as name and description), will not be imported and must be added manually.\nFor projects without a specific extent, you can use the FWS regional geography. Projects should have custom extents when it is relevant to the scope of the project. Remember, these extents will be used for search and discovery purposes. geoJSON files for all FWS regional and state geographies are available on ScienceBase (private DMWG folder that requires ScienceBase login). Download the relevant files and then import into mdEditor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nImportant: coordinates used must be geographic coordinates, not projected coordinates. {% endhint %}\n\n\n\n\nOption 2: Draw Spatial Features\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTip: It is easier to click “finish” when drawing a polygon instead of trying to close the polygon by clicking on the first point.\n\n\n\n\nOption 3: Draw Bounding Box\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nmdEditor can automatically calculate a bounding box if you have at least one extent in the metadata.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Geographic Extent entry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBounding boxes will not work across the dateline but you can have more than one extent per project.

Choose a project and its products to test.\nBEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: It’s recommended that you export a project and its products into its own mdEditor file. Set default parent identifier as a ScienceBase folder.\nIf you DO already have items on ScienceBase, choose one of the following approaches. Note that this procedure may affect your existing records.\nApproach #1) Take a simple project and product set, and make a copy of the mdEditor records. In the test version, delete all ScienceBase IDs (SBIDs) and parent IDs. The SBID will either be located in the citation, or if you imported the record from SB, the SBID will be the record identifier. Set default parent identifier as a folder.\nApproach #2) Publish directly to a real record if you have confirmed a backup copy exists, in the event that the record is deleted in ScienceBase.\nSet your Default Parent Identifier in Settings.\nSelect one project with its associated products to test.\nFollow the publishing instructions above for the scenario that applies to you.\nLook for any errors in the third column. If you see an error that is 400 and red, it’s a problem that you can address. However, if it’s a 500 level error in red, that is a ScienceBase error that is outside the scope of the mdEditor.\n\nNOTE: Any unsolvable issues can be submitted on the issues page for mdEditor: https://github.com/adiwg/mdEditor/issues. You must have a github account in order to post.\nAdvanced users can check errors using the console. Consult the Advanced Users section of this manual to learn more.\nVerify that your test records have published as expected in your folder on ScienceBase (or to the real record if that’s how you are testing).\nAfter you are satisfied with how your test records published to ScienceBase, continue to step 10.\nUpdate your mdEditor settings to your real Default Parent Identifier.\nUsing the record you just tested, proceed with publishing to the real location on ScienceBase.\nMake sure any test SBIDs are removed entirely from the record you want to actually publish.\nVerify that the real records have updated as expected.\nProceed with publishing your other records to their real locations. It is advisable to publish 1 or 2 records at a time, since ScienceBase can time-out and fail when publishing records simultaneously.",

Including these keywords helps to align the work of USFWS Science Applications with global conservation efforts and to utilize the shared resources of the Conservation Standards Network. The open standards keywords for conservation actions are as listed:\n\n\n\nLand / Water Management  (1.0)\n\n\n\n\nSite/Area Stewardship (1.1)\n\n\nEcosystem & natural process (re)creation (1.2)\n\n\nSpecies Management  (2.0)\n\n\nSpecies stewardship (2.1)\n\n\nSpecies re-introduction & translocation (2.2)\n\n\nEx-situ conservation (2.3)\n\n\nAwareness Raising  (3)\n\n\nOutreach & communications (3.1)\n\n\nProtests & Civil Disobedience (3.2)\n\n\nLaw Enforcement and Protection (4.0)\n\n\nDetection & Arrest (4.1)\n\n\nCriminal Prosecution & Conviction (4.2)\n\n\nNon-Criminal Legal Action (4.3)\n\n\nLivelihood, Economic, and Moral Incentives  (5)\n\n\nLinked enterprises & alternative livelihoods (5.1)\n\n\nBetter products & management practices (5.2)\n\n\nMarket-base incentives (5.3)\n\n\nDirect economic incentives (5.4)\n\n\nNon-monetary values (5.5)\n\n\nConservation Designation and Planning  (6)\n\n\nProtected area designation or acquisition (6.1)\n\n\nEasements & Resource rights (6.2)\n\n\nLand/Water use zoning & designation (6.3)\n\n\nConservation planning (6.4)\n\n\nSite Infrastructure (6.5)\n\n\nLegal & Policy Frameworks  (7)\n\n\nLaws, regulations, & codes (7.1)\n\n\nPolicies & guidelines (7.2)\n\n\nResearch and Monitoring  (8)\n\n\nBasic research & Status monitoring (8.1)\n\n\nEvaluation, effectiveness measures & learning (8.2)\n\n\nEducation and Training  (9)\n\n\nFormal education (9.1)\n\n\nTraining & individual capacity development (9.2)\n\n\nInstitutional Development  (10)\n\n\nInternal organizational management & administration (10.1)\n\n\nExternal organizational development & support (10.2)\n\n\nAlliance & partnership development (10.3)\n\n\nFinancing conservation (10.4)\n\n\n\n\n\nGCMD Keywords (Best Practice)\nGCMD stands for Global Change Master Directory and these keywords are maintained by NASA. Look for useful keywords in the GCMD Science Keywords. There are GCMD Platforms and Instruments Keywords but they are unlikely to apply to LCCs.\n\nBest Practice: Check the “Full Path” checkbox to save the full path of the keyword to your metadata. This will maintain the category and context of the specific keywords chosen.",

It is a tool to add known taxonomic information to your metadata. If you want to explore ITIS, go to itis.gov to find information and then come back to mdEditor with the desired search values.\n\nThe minimum requirements for valid taxonomy are a Taxonomic System plus one or more taxonomic classifications.\n\nAdd Taxonomic System\n(1) Click “Add Collection”\n\n(2) From here, you can click “Add Taxa from ITIS” directly (on right side) without adding the taxonomic system. This will be filled in for you automatically once you have added items from ITIS.\n\n(3) Enter your search terms in the search box. You can type in a common name, scientific name, or TSN (Taxonomic Serial Number, assigned by ITIS). You can type in any level of taxonomy, not just species name (e.g., you can type in an order or class or genus). You can specify by Kingdom if you like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t used the search in a while (or ever) the ITIS service might be asleep so it will take a few more seconds to load but then will load quickly after that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe status of the taxonomic classification is denoted in () after the TSN. ITIS may consider a classification “invalid” if the species was reclassified, for example. It is up to you whether you want to add invalid ITIS classifications to your metadata.\n\n\n\n(4) Click “Add” for the search results you want to add to your record and then click “Import Taxa.” You will get a message of successful import at the bottom of your screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou don’t need to worry about clicking import multiple times for the same species. mdEditor is smart enough to know not to create duplicate entries of the same species.\n\n\n\n(5) Click “Back to Collection.” You will see that it has added a taxonomic hierarchy.

If you prefer, you can use a generic data manager contact rather than an individual name.\nAt least one contact with the role of “author” is required.\n\n\n\nFunding / Allocation (for Projects only)\n\nSource (Required)\nAdd the relevant contact for the “source” of the project funding. Source should be an organization, not an individual. For FWS projects, the default source is U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Regions or programs should be added as the funding “administrator” in the Other Contacts field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFunding source should always identify the agency or organization, rather than a sub-program or office. For example, all funding from other FWS programs need to list U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as the source (and not list the source as Fisheries, specific Refuges, ES, etc.). Clarifications on the exact program or office where the funding came from can be done through the Funding/Other Contacts field (and choose the role of “administrator”).\n\n\n\n\nRecipient (Required)\nAdd the relevant contact for the “recipient” of the project funding. Recipient should always be an organization, not an individual. For example, the Principal Investigator would not be listed as the recipient, but their organization would be. If there are multiple recipients for a project, they should be added as separate allocations.\nThe Principal Investigator may be added n the Other Contacts field as “principalInvestigator.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFunding administrator can also be used to differentiate funding from different programs/offices within the same agency. For example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service can be identified as the funding source and the funding administrator could include “Ecological Services” or a specific field office.\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution (for Products only)\n\nAdd the relevant contact for “distributor” of the product.",

    "text": "We envision a well-functioning data management, integration, and sharing process that integrates, at minimum, the products of SA-funded projects with those from regionally-funded projects, and that support the data lifecycle in a coordinated manner. —Conservation Science Plan v.1\nIn the beginning, Science Applications was leading the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives: A network of individual, geographically distinct partnerships coordinated by SA. The 22 Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) developed uniquely and independently based on the needs of their regions and partnerships. As a result, there was not a single workflow for data management and sharing among the LCCs. Instead there were multiple workflows, varying formats, and different use cases for managing and sharing the results of LCC-funded projects. Further, because LCCs placed varying levels of importance on data management, LCCs varied greatly in their staff capacity for data management.\nWhile the individual workflows met the needs of the individual LCCs and their partner organizations, they were not enough to achieve the goal of a network-wide, integrated dynamic project and product database. Through collective agreement, LCCs agreed they needed to modify their workflows to create comparable project and product metadata.\nProcedurally, the LCC Network has committed to using ScienceBase for cataloging all funded projects and associated products. As per the LCC Network’s response to a DOI Office of the Inspector General 2017 report, individual LCCs must contribute their project and product metadata to the ScienceBase repository by the end of 2017 and mid-2018 respectively. In tandem with this ScienceBase requirement, the LCC Network is required to post data products to data.gov and this data conduit will be in place with products cataloged by end of 2018.\nWhile SA has refocused on FWS priorities, the need for data management, integration, and sharing process remains essential to mission of FWS and SA. This guidance was developed by the SA Data Management Working Group (DMWG) with the leadership of the Architecture Subgroup (ASG).",

This means that if you use a different browser to access mdEditor, it will not show the metadata records from your original browser. It also means that clearing your browser’s cache generally will not delete your mdEditor records. However, depending on your browser’s settings, clearing your browser cache may still delete your mdEditor data (e.g., in Chrome, checking the “cookies and other site data” option will clear your mdEditor data).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIn mdEditor settings, you can clear your storage cache. Doing so will remove all of the information currently loaded in mdEditor. Reasons you might want to clear your storage cache is due to too much information stored in the cache, or as a way to debug a problem with mdEditor. It is very important that you back up your records before clearing the mdEditor cache to avoid losing your data. Consult the Export or Settings section of this manual to learn more.",

    "section": "mdEditor File Management Strategies",
    "text": "mdEditor File Management Strategies\n\n(1) Work on a project-by-project basis.\nTo keep file size manageable, it is recommended that you work on one project (and its related products and contacts) at a time. You should group said project, products, and contacts together using the same scheme that your LCC uses to organize data.\n\nSave each project and affiliated products together as a set. To do this, select “Export” from the top menu, then select the appropriate records (i.e., the target project and its affiliated products) and then click “Export Selected.”\nSave the resulting mdEditor JSON file to your hard drive in a working folder. There should be a separate mdEditor JSON file for each project and all of its products.\n\n\n\n(2) Leave information in mdEditor between work sessions.\nIt is recommended that you leave your contacts in mdEditor between work sessions so that they will be available the next time you need to create metadata records. You can also export your contacts independently of your records for use between browsers.\nYou can also set up a metadata directory so you can always find the metadata file. This directory can be any folder on your local computer that is easily accessible and will not be deleted.\n\n\n(3) Export your contacts with your records.\nWhen exporting products or projects, you should also export your entire contact list. If you do not export your contact list, and you later import a record that contains a contact not loaded in mdEditor, you may receive an error and have to re-create and re-enter the contact for that record.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf contacts records are re-created, it results in another mdEditor identifier being created for a contact, resulting in duplicate contacts. mdEditor does not know that this is an existing contact. You should maintain a single list of your contacts. Having duplicate copies of the same contact is not desirable. It can create confusion as you edit and manage your metadata records and introduce unnecessary errors.\n\n\n\n\n(4) Export frequently to backup your records.\nMaintain an “Export All” JSON file each time you finish a work session in mdEditor (or switch browsers, URLs, etc.). This is the most efficient way to backup your records. For more information, consult Export.\nIt is particularly important that you export your records for backup before using mdEditor’s Clear Storage Cache functionality (clearing the storage cache will delete any records or data you have entered in mdEditor). Exporting ensures that your data is secure even after clearing the storage cache. Not exporting your data before clearing your cache will result in a permanent loss of records.

    "text": "Based on a 2017 OIG audit, minimal metadata fields are required to be published within 30-days of project funding. The purpose of this policy is to share information with partners regarding what science projects SA is supporting. This transparency helps to reduce duplication of efforts across funding agencies and allows partners to discover and engage in SA supported science as desired.\n\n\n\nQuick Reference: Project metadata for Non Duplication Policy\nRequired\n\n\n\n\nBasic Information: Title, Status\nRequired\n\n\nPoint of Contacts (see Main Tab: Project)\nRequired\n\n\nDescription: Abstract\nRequired\n\n\nTime Period\nRequired\n\n\nFunding: Award Number, amount, source, fiscal year, recipients\nRequired\n\n\n\nBelow is a copy of the Non Duplication Policy guidance memo, in detail for reference:\n\nGuidance for Preventing Duplication of Research and Other Science Activities\n\nBackground\nOn September 1, 2017, and December 7, 2017, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) issued memos detailing actions all Assistant Regional Directors, Science Applications (SA-ARDs), must take to prevent duplication of research across Science Applications and United States Geological Survey Climate Adaptation Science Centers (CASCs). This document provides further guidance for how to best comply with those memos, in addition to other measures that can be undertaken to prevent duplicative research across Science Applications, CASCs, and other federal programs. See this Non-Duplication Policies Dashboard for a list of resources.\n\n\nSummary of Required Actions\nFor all financial assistance and inter-/intra-agency agreements or contracts for research projects and other science activities you must do what is outlined in the list below. Unless otherwise specified, the following applies to all science projects funded with SA applications monies (1410, 1420, and 1430):\n\nFirst determine if the project is a research project or other science activity. Consider whether the project will result in a science product (e.g. survey, study, tool, assessment, publication, etc.).\n\n\nIf you decide that it IS NOT research or another type of other science activity, document your decision using this template and attach it to the official award file.\n\n\nIf you decide that it IS research or another type of science activity, proceed with the steps outlined below.\nSearch for duplicative projects in ScienceBase (use the ScienceBase search template).\nAdd this language to the NOFO: “Applicants must document literature searches (e.g. academic literature, industry publication, ScienceBase, and Data.gov). Applicants should explain why their project is non-duplicative and how it will augment existing knowledge.”\nInclude peer review as part of project selection.\nYou must document consultation with the appropriate CASC director(s). Send an email to Anna-Marie York (Anna-Marie_York@fws.gov) to obtain an electronic form to document consultation with CASC directors. The form link can be shared with anyone in the Department of the Interior and offers the ability to create a spreadsheet that summarizes responses, including a time stamp for when each respondent completed the form.\nAfter consultation with CASCs is complete, the SA-ARD must provide a memo to the file (template here) certifying that consultation occurred. (Note: for grants and cooperative agreements the ARD may instead certify consultation was done by checking the appropriate box and signing the New Award Checklist - FWS Form 3-2460). Include a copy of the spreadsheet of responses as part of the official award file.\nEnter all project information into ScienceBase as soon as possible, but within 30 days of the agreement being in place (required per September 2017 memo). Provide as much information about projects as possible and update regularly, including adding entries for products within 30 days of receipt. See the ScienceBase Guidance section below for further details.\n\n\n\nRequired and Recommended Practices\nAs denoted by “(required)” in the list below, only practices 2, 5, and 6 are required per policy; the others are recommended but are not required. Note: required actions are the same as those listed above in the Summary of Required Actions. Unless otherwise specified, the following applies to all science projects funded with SA applications monies (1410, 1420, and 1430).\n\nDetermine if the project is a research project or other science activity (required). Consider whether the project will result in a science product (e.g. survey, study, tool, assessment, publication, etc.).\n\n\nIf you decide that it IS NOT research or another type of other science activity, document your decision using this template and attach it to the official award file (required).\n\n\nIf you decide that it IS research or another type of science activity, proceed with the steps outlined below.\nConsider coordinating with other federal agencies prior to the project funding phase:\n\nYou may consult informally during project development, or, when appropriate, invite staff from CASCs and other federal programs to be peer reviewers.\nWhen invited and able, consider participating in the project development and selection phases for other agencies’ research programs.\n\nSearch ScienceBase.gov for potentially duplicative projects prior to funding (required):\n\nDocument your search of ScienceBase using the ScienceBase search template.\n\n\nDo multiple searches (i.e. varying search terms and criteria) as necessary.\nBe expansive in your search – use a variety of search terms and limit the scope only as necessary. You should not limit your search to CASC communities.\n\n\n\nInclude copies of ScienceBase search template and corresponding results (spreadsheet) in the financial award file.\n\n\nRepeat Practice 2 at https://catalog.data.gov and any other relevant federal databases. You can use the ScienceBase search template to document these searches, though note that some of the instructions on the template are specific to ScienceBase.\nInsert this language in NOFO: “Applicants must document literature searchers (e.g. academic literature, industry publication, ScienceBase, and Data.gov). Applicants should explain why their project is non-duplicative and how it will augment existing knowledge.”(required)\nConsult with CASCs once you have selected a project to fund, but prior to funding. Email Anna-Marie_York@fws.gov to obtain a link to a form to send to CASC directors (required).\n\nUse the results of ScienceBase searches, informal consultations, and/or serving on review panels to identify CASCs that have funded similar research. You may also consider any CASC in your project geography. Aim to be expansive.\nConsider sending the form to leadership from other federal agencies as well.\nUsing google forms will allow us to download a spreadsheet of time-stamped responses. Email Anna_Marie_York@fws.gov for a copy of the resulting spreadsheet.\nInclude a copy of the responses (spreadsheet) in the financial award file.\n\nAfter consultation with CASCs is complete, the SA-ARD must provide a memo to the file (template here) certifying that consultation occurred. (Note: for grants and cooperative agreements the ARD may instead certify consultation was done by checking the appropriate box and signing the New Award Checklist - FWS Form 3-2460). Include a copy of the spreadsheet of responses as part of the official award file.\nEnter all project information into ScienceBase as soon as possible, but within 30 days of the agreement being in place (required per September 2017 memo). Provide as much information about projects as possible and update regularly, including adding entries for products within 30 days of receipt. See the ScienceBase Guidance section below for further details.\n\n\n\nScienceBase Guidance\n\nEvery region has folders in ScienceBase to put basic information about the science projects you have funded since September 30, 2017; per policy this is required within 30 days of funding a project or receiving a product. Here is what’s required for each project/product:\n\nTitle\nPI/Funding recipient’s[1] Name and Contact info\nPI/Funding Recipient’s Organization\nStart Date\nProjected End Date\nAbstract\nAward ID\nFunding Sources and Amounts\n\nYou can use mdEditor to make the records if that is your preference, or do it directly in ScienceBase. Here is a video tutorial showing how to enter directly on ScienceBase.\nIf you have a science activity that more than one FWS region contributed funds to, but there was a “lead region” that actually administered a single financial award / contract, then that lead region should create and maintain a single record in ScienceBase for the project and its products. The project record should list the total amount of Service funds in the financial / award contract (i.e., all regions combined).\nIf you have a science activity with multiple financial awards / contracts, then each award / contract should have its own ScienceBase record (note: modifications ARE NOT considered new awards / contracts). Whichever region administered each financial award / contract should create and maintain project and product records in ScienceBase. Please include the ScienceBase URL(s) for the related projects in the abstract. Example language: “this project is part of a larger initiative; you can find related records here: URL 1, URL 2, …”).\nIf you need “editing” access to your region’s ScienceBase folder email Jill Cohen (jillian_cohen@fws.gov).\nIf you want a little more detail about what the “ScienceBase” policy is start with slides from a presentation Jill gave to the Data Management Working Group August 2018.\nIf you want all the details about the non-duplication policies. This dashboard is your gateway.\nIf you read through the slides and other documents and still have questions, or just want to check to make sure you’re doing things right call or email Jill Cohen (jillian_cohen@fws.gov; 703-358-1764).\n\n[1] The memo itself uses the term “project leader” instead of PI/funding recipient.",

Note that the entry format is different. As an online resource, the entire url is required, however, as an identifier, only the prefix and suffix of the DOI are required (see figure above).\n\n\nBest Practice: Create and use internal identifiers that are unique within your region for projects and their products. Example: GNLCC2010-11.\n\n\nIf your item does not have a ScienceBase ID (SBID) yet, ScienceBase will create one automatically upon publishing. If you imported your item from ScienceBase originally, then the SBID will already be included in Metadata/Metadata Identifier and you do not need to include it here. Note that if you edit an item that is already on ScienceBase without using its existing SBID, a duplicate item will be created on ScienceBase. Consult the Publish section of this manual to learn more.\n\n\nIf the product metadata was created by copying another mdEditor metadata record, this identifier MUST be edited/changed since it will reflect the copied record identifier.

For example, 59b97600e4b091459a54d9f3c is the SBID for the item at the URL: https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/59b97600e4b091459a54d9f3c\n\n\n\n\nExample Parent Metadata entry",

It strongly recommended that you do not type these in by hand on individual metadata records.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Metadata Repository entry",

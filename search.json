This tool was initially developed by the Alaska Data Integration Working Group and adopted by SA. The mdEditor application is under constant development. Consequently, there may be some minor discrepancies between screenshots in this guidance and the current version of mdEditor.\nThis manual refers to the creation of SA metadata specifically.

    "text": "Projects, products, and contacts all share a relationship in mdEditor and are each entered independently.\n\nProjects\nA project encompasses a discrete effort on a particular topic with defined goals or objectives. The target projects for the SA Science Catalog are science projects whose topics and resulting products have value to partners or the public being able to discover and access them. Many projects are the result of SA issued financial assistance agreements, contracts, or inter-agency agreements. However, not everything funded through one of these mechanisms needs to be in the Science Catalog. For example, a contract to maintain an individual website likely does not quality as a “science project” nor does it provide public-relevant information. A grant to develop an interactive landscape-conservation tool, however, would be a science project that results in public-relevant information.\nSA projects can also include other defined efforts that did not necessarily require the awarding of funds (i.e. internal efforts).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual data managers may want to track other projects using the same metadata format and store that information on ScienceBase, without publishing it to the SA Science Catalog.\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\nA product is a resource, usually (but not necessarily) developed as an output from a project. Products can be tools, data, maps, reports, presentations, workshops, etc. These will usually be the direct result of a project though there may be some products without a parent project.\nNot every output of a project is necessarily a product, however. For example, meeting minutes do not have standalone value as a publicly-available resource. It is up to each data manager to determine which outputs should be entered as products.\n\n\nContacts\nContacts are the individuals and organizations involved with projects and products (e.g., investigators, collaborators, funders). Contacts are entered once in mdEditor and can be added to multiple projects and products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsult the Contacts section for information on adding contacts.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelationships\nProjects and Products will always have a relationship with contacts. Projects will always have at least one point of contact (FWS SA National Data Steward). Additional contact relationships may include project authors, metadata creators, funders, principal investigators, publishers, distributors, and many others. One crucial contact relationship between contacts, projects, and products is the role of the individual(s) and/or organization(s) who provided funding. This may include a direct full contributor or any partners that provided funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact types are specified in the contact record (examples: federal, state, NGO). Specific roles for each contact are defined within the respective project and product records (examples: principal investigator, collaborator).\n\n\n\nProducts are often the results of projects. mdEditor defines the relationships between projects and products through the Associated feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsult either the Associating Records: Product or Associating Records: Project section for more information.",

You cannot publish until you are logged in.\n\n\nThe mdEditor Publishing Outline:\nYou will see a list of every valid record in mdEditor in the publishing outline with its ScienceBase Identifier (if the record already exists on ScienceBase) and its parent ScienceBase Identifier (if present in the metadata). This publishing outline shows records in a parent-child relationship and reflects what you would see when you publish to ScienceBase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRemember: Parent-Child relationships refer to how the records are organized and displayed on ScienceBase. This is different than the Project and Product associations identified within the metadata records.\n\n\n\nRecords without parent IDs already in their metadata will appear directly under the ScienceBase header in the publishing outline. These records will be published under the default parent identifier you established in the settings. The Default parent identifier is listed in the ScienceBase header, which is hyperlinked to the record on ScienceBase.\nRecords with parent IDs identified in their metadata will appear below a thick blue line and will be published under the parent ID listed in their metadata.\n\n\n\n\nItems directly below the ScienceBase header will be published under the ScienceBase item identified in your settings as “Default Parent Identifier.” Items below the blue line will be published under the parent ID specified in the metadata.\nFor example, if the Default Parent Identifier is your SA Community, then projects at the root level in the publishing outline will be added directly under your SA Community. Products nested under a project in the outline will be added as a direct child item to the project item on ScienceBase. (Note: you may have other parent IDs identified in those records that are not loaded in mdEditor)\n\n\n\nNotes on Moving Records\nYou can drag and drop records to establish the parent-child relationship in the publish outline, eliminating the need to establish that relationship in ScienceBase. This will also allow you to move items around (e.g., move a product from one project to another) and see that change reflected on ScienceBase. Remember, this only affects parent-child relationships on ScienceBase (i.e. file structure in ScienceBase), not project-product associations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you do not want these parent IDs to change, do not drag and drop these records in the publishing outline.\n\n\n\nGeneral Notes on Parent IDs:\n\nIf you move a product under a different project, it will update that product’s parent ID.\nParent IDs established through the relationships in the publishing outline will overwrite existing parent IDs in the metadata.\nDragging and dropping a record onto the ScienceBase header at the top will set that record’s parent ID to the default parent ID you identified in Settings.\nIf you have existing parent IDs in your metadata (and want to keep them as is), do not drag and drop those records onto the ScienceBase header– this will erase the existing parent ID and insert what you have set as the default parent identifier.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Move Records in the Publishing Outline\nBefore you move records in the publishing outline please select your scenario below and follow the corresponding guidance.\n\nScenario A\nYou do not have items on ScienceBase yet, and your desired parent-child relationship is to have each product as a direct child of a project item on ScienceBase:\n\nYour records will all display under the ScienceBase header in the publishing outline.\n\nThese items will be published as a direct child item under the SB item identified in your settings under “Default Parent Identifier.”\n\nYou can drag and drop records in the publishing outline to establish parent-child relationships for ScienceBase.\nYou can nest items in as many levels as you desire (the most common is a product nested under a project).\nTo move a record back to the root level, drag and drop it on the top line that says “ScienceBase Default”.\n\n\n\nScenario B\nYou have existing parent-child relationships on ScienceBase and/or you have intermediate folder(s) between project items and products (i.e., products are not direct child items of Project Items - this is not recommended).\n\nIf you have parent-child relationships already established on ScienceBase (and those IDs are reflected in the mdEditor records), you likely do not want to move the records around in the publishing outline.\nIf your products are housed in a “Products” folder on ScienceBase (or other intermediate folders between the project item and the products), then your products will not be nested under projects in the publishing outline.\n\nThe parent ID for those products is the “Products” folder (which would not have a record in mdEditor). If this is your situation, do not change the structure in the publishing outline and publish as is (i.e., with every item organized at the root level in the outline).\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Submit for Publishing\n\nTo select a record to publish, click on it and it will turn green (click again to un-select it).\nYou cannot publish a record without a parent ID. Sending a non-existent parent ID to ScienceBase will return an error. If your records contain parent IDs in the metadata, you can choose to publish products without publishing their associated projects at the same time.\nmdEditor will publish your records sequentially, starting with the top record (it will publish the project first, then the products nested below it).\n\nIf you are publishing to your default parent identifier or if you have changed any project-product relationships in the publishing outline, you will see the updated parent IDs appear in the outline as publishing occurs. If you’re publishing to the existing locations on ScienceBase, the IDs will not change.\nThese new/updated IDs will be injected directly into the mdJSON file in mdEditor. However, these updated IDs will not be included in the mdJSON file that is attached to ScienceBase as part of the publishing process. You would have to publish the record a second time to update the mdJSON file attached on ScienceBase.\n\nUpon successfully publishing to ScienceBase, the third column will display a date and time. The record’s ScienceBase ID will be displayed in the first column, and the Parent ID will be displayed in the second column. If there are any errors during publishing, they will be noted in the third column.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Review Records on ScienceBase\n\nOnce publishing is done, refresh ScienceBase to ensure everything is showing up how you expected it would show up.\n\nSB items should have an mdJSON and XML file attached\nSB items should be in the location reflected in the mdEditor publishing outline\n\nYou can re-publish records as needed (e.g., after updating or correcting metadata).\n\n\n\nStep 5: Review Entries in the SA Science Catalog\nThe Science Catalog updates overnight so you should review newly-published records the day after you publish to ScienceBase. This will be one of your best quality control checks.",

Having duplicate copies of the same contact is not desirable. It can create confusion and unnecessary duplication errors as you edit and manage your metadata records.\n\n\nCopying contacts will change the ID and the name (the name will be “Copy of …”) but all the other information will remain the same in the copy.\nIt is recommended that you leave contacts in mdEditor between work sessions. This allows you to readily add contacts to projects and products.\nIt is recommended that when you export records, you also export your entire contact list. If you do not export your contact list, and you later import a record that contains a contact not in your library, you may receive an error and have to re-enter the contact to that record.

Key information to gather includes project proposals, funding agreements and amounts, project reports, product information, and contact information for individuals and organizations involved in the projects.\nUse the “contacts seed file” that contains pre-filled information and standard naming conventions for all SA regions, common federal agencies, and the SA National Data Steward.\n\n\n2. Open mdEditor\nThe direct link to mdEditor is https://go.mdeditor.org. Choose the browser you plan to use for mdEditor and bookmark this link.\nThe mdEditor homepage provides some background information and Frequently Asked Questions about mdEditor.\nAlways hit Refresh in your browser before each work session (and periodically throughout the session) to ensure that you are using the most updated version of mdEditor.\n\n\n3. Adjust settings\nIn mdEditor settings, set the SA-specific settings for importing from ScienceBase, Metadata Repositories, and Publishing (See Settings).\n\n\n4. Create or import contacts\nContacts must be created or uploaded before they can be added to project and product metadata records using the Contacts entry form in mdEditor.\nSA has a “seed list” of contacts that that contains standardized information for common partner agencies, USFWS regions, and the SA Network Data Steward. This Contacts Seed file (as a .json) can be downloaded from the mdEditor Seed Contacts item page. and then imported into mdEditor using the Import tab.\n\n\n5. Create projects\nFor creating metadata for a project you will need to create an mdEditor project record from scratch.\nOn the main page’s left menu-bar next to “Metadata Records” click on the plus (+) sign to add a new record.\n\nFill in the rest of the information in main tab, as needed.\n\n\n6. Create products\nFor creating metadata for a product you will need to create an mdEditor product record from scratch.\nOn the main page’s left menu-bar next to “Metadata Records” click on the plus (+) sign to add a new record.\n\nFill in the rest of the information in main tab, as needed.\n\n\n7. Create or import data dictionaries\nIf a product record have a need for data dictionaries, create or import one.\n\n\n8. Complete metadata\nDecide on your desired file management approach and complete your metadata accordingly. See the File Management section for options and instructions.\n\n\n9. Create associations\nFor projects and/or products, associations can be either associated from a project or associated from a product.\n\n\n10. Publish your records\nFrom the mdEditor interface, publish the records to ScienceBase.\n\n\n11. Export your records\nUse the Export function to export records of your products, projects, and contacts for backup, transfer, or sharing. You may want to export working backups before publishing depending on your situation, but archival exports should be done after publishing since publishing can alter records, like adding or changing a ScienceBase ID.\n\n\n12. Review Science Catalog\nThe SA Science Catalog updates overnight so you should review newly-published records the day after you publish to ScienceBase. This will be one of your best quality control checks.",

This exports an mdEditor file containing all records and contacts currently loaded in mdEditor.\nWhen exporting products or projects, you should also export your entire contact list. If you do not export your contact list, and you later import a record that contains a contact not in your mdEditor library, you may receive an error and have to re-create and re-enter the contact to that record.\nIt is particularly important that you export your records for backup before using mdEditor’s Clear Storage Cache functionality (clearing the storage cache will delete any records or data you have entered into the mdEditor). Exporting ensures that your data is secure even after clearing the storage cache. Not exporting your data before clearing your cache will result in a permanent loss of records.

Exports just the mdJSON file, which is a standalone JSON file you can load into mdTranslator and have translated into other metadata formats. mdJSON files imported into mdEditor are treated as new records and will not merge/update an existing record.\nClicking the Include Settings switch will also export mdEditor settings (only for mdEditor files). Consult the Settings section of this manual to learn about settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you need to switch browsers for mdEditor, or want to send your settings to someone else, you can export the settings.

Doing so will remove all of the information currently loaded in mdEditor. Reasons you might want to clear your storage cache is due to too much information stored in the cache, or as a way to debug a problem with mdEditor.

    "section": "mdEditor File Management Strategies",
    "text": "mdEditor File Management Strategies\n\n1. Work on a project-by-project basis.\nTo keep file size manageable, it is recommended that you work on one project (and its related products and contacts) at a time. You should group said project, products, and contacts together using the same scheme that your group uses to organize data.\n\nSave each project and affiliated products together as a set. To do this, select “Export” from the top menu, then select the appropriate records (i.e., the target project and its affiliated products) and then click “Export Selected.”\nSave the resulting mdEditor JSON file to your hard drive in a working folder. There should be a separate mdEditor JSON file for each project and all of its products.\n\n\n\n2. Leave information in mdEditor between work sessions.\nIt is recommended that you leave your contacts in mdEditor between work sessions so that they will be available the next time you need to create metadata records. You can also export your contacts independently of your records for use between browsers.\nYou can also set up a metadata directory so you can always find the metadata file. This directory can be any folder on your local computer that is easily accessible and will not be deleted.\n\n\n3. Export your contacts with your records.\nWhen exporting products or projects, you should also export your entire contact list. If you do not export your contact list, and you later import a record that contains a contact not loaded in mdEditor, you may receive an error and have to re-create and re-enter the contact for that record.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning: If contacts records are re-created, it results in another mdEditor identifier being created for a contact, resulting in duplicate contacts. mdEditor does not know that this is an existing contact. You should maintain a single list of your contacts. Having duplicate copies of the same contact is not desirable. It can create confusion as you edit and manage your metadata records and introduce unnecessary errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Export frequently to backup your records.\nMaintain an “Export All” JSON file each time you finish a work session in mdEditor (or switch browsers, URLs, etc.). This is the most efficient way to backup your records. For more information, consult Export.\nIt is particularly important that you export your records for backup before using mdEditor’s Clear Storage Cache functionality (clearing the storage cache will delete any records or data you have entered in mdEditor). Exporting ensures that your data is secure even after clearing the storage cache. Not exporting your data before clearing your cache will result in a permanent loss of records.

Taxonomy is entered in a separate section in mdJSON so they are separate from Keywords.\n\n\nTo some extent, this is up to the judgement of the data manager. You will know best the connection of a resource to a specific species or other taxonomic group. For example, if a bear model was used to rank habitat for a prioritization product but the final output is not relevant to bears any longer, then you probably wouldn’t want to add bear species in taxonomy.",

At least one  of these date types is required.\n\n\nResponsible Parties (Required)\nThis must include a point of contact, but may also include other responsible parties such as funders, partners, collaborators, and contributors.

Data.gov refers to this online resource link to send users to the data download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nImportant: The URLs to access and download products must also be included in the Distribution tab. Distribution Links is the only online resource that Data.gov reads so without a URL there, users have no way to access the actual product from Data.gov.\n\n\n\n\nIdentifier (Required)\nYou may enter as many Identifiers as needed, but at least one  is required. Identifiers are unique codes that identify a metadata records and enable metadata management and cataloging. An Identifier is a unique character string and the Namespace describes the environment (e.g., ScienceBase, ITIS, etc.) or type (e.g., mapProjection, UUID, etc.) of the identifier. If you have internal SA specific IDs for projects, enter them here. A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is the preferred identifier for this. The Archive Folder Name may be included here as well.\n\n\n\nExample of Online resource and identifier metadata entries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDigital Object Identifier can be entered both as an online resource AND an identifier. Note that the entry format is different. As an online resource, the entire url is required, however, as an identifier, only the prefix and suffix of the DOI are required (see figure above).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Practice\n\n\n\nCreate and use internal identifiers that are unique within your region for projects and their products. Example: GNLCC2010-11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf your item does not have a ScienceBase ID (SBID) yet, ScienceBase will create one automatically upon publishing. If you imported your item from ScienceBase originally, then the SBID will already be included in Metadata/Metadata Identifier and you do not need to include it here. Note that if you edit an item that is already on ScienceBase without using its existing SBID, a duplicate item will be created on ScienceBase. Consult the Publish section of this manual to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf the product metadata was created by copying another mdEditor metadata record, this identifier MUST be edited/changed since it will reflect the copied record identifier. Only the mdEditor UUID changes to represent a new record when an item is copied. Consult the Copy Records section of this manual to learn how to make a copy.",

    "text": "Science Applications originally coordinated the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives — a network of individual, geographically distinct partnerships. The 22 Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) developed uniquely and independently based on the needs of their regions and partnerships. As a result, there was not a single workflow for data management and sharing among the LCCs. Instead there were multiple workflows, varying formats, and different use cases for managing and sharing the results of LCC-funded projects. Further, because LCCs placed varying levels of importance on data management, LCCs varied greatly in their staff capacity for data management.\nWhile the individual workflows met the needs of the individual LCCs and their partner organizations, they were not enough to achieve the goal of a network-wide, integrated dynamic project and product database. Through collective agreement, LCCs agreed they needed to modify their workflows to create comparable project and product metadata.\nProcedurally, the LCC Network has committed to using ScienceBase for cataloging all funded projects and associated products. As per the LCC Network’s response to a DOI Office of the Inspector General 2017 report, individual LCCs were required to contribute their project and product metadata to the ScienceBase repository by the end of 2017 and mid-2018 respectively. In tandem with this ScienceBase requirement, the LCC Network was required to post data products to Data.gov and this data conduit be in place with products cataloged by end of 2018.\nWhile SA has refocused on FWS priorities, the need for data management, integration, and sharing process remains essential to mission of FWS and SA. This guidance was developed by the SA Data Management Working Group (DMWG) with the leadership of the Architecture Subgroup (ASG).",

It is a tool to add known taxonomic information to your metadata. If you want to explore ITIS, go to itis.gov to find information and then come back to mdEditor with the desired search values.\n\nThe minimum requirements for valid taxonomy are a Taxonomic System plus one or more taxonomic classifications.\n\nAdd Taxonomic System\n\nClick “Add Collection”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom here, you can click “Add Taxa from ITIS” directly (on right side) without adding the taxonomic system. This will be filled in for you automatically once you have added items from ITIS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter your search terms in the search box. You can type in a common name, scientific name, or TSN (Taxonomic Serial Number, assigned by ITIS). You can type in any level of taxonomy, not just species name (e.g., you can type in an order or class or genus). You can specify by Kingdom if you like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t used the search in a while (or ever) the ITIS service might be asleep so it will take a few more seconds to load but then will load quickly after that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe status of the taxonomic classification is denoted as (status) after the TSN. ITIS may consider a classification “invalid” if the species was reclassified, for example. It is up to you whether you want to add invalid ITIS classifications to your metadata.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick “Add” for the search results you want to add to your record and then click “Import Taxa.” You will get a message of successful import at the bottom of your screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou don’t need to worry about clicking import multiple times for the same species. mdEditor is smart enough to know not to create duplicate entries of the same species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick “Back to Collection.” You will see that it has added a taxonomic hierarchy. It has also added a Title to Taxonomic System (if you hadn’t already added one by hand). This complete the the minimum information required for taxonomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can click on any level of the taxonomic hierarchy to collapse the entries below that level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nmdEditor only adds common names at the lowest taxonomic level you identified (e.g., species level).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can add additional information regarding the taxonomic information if you desire.\nObservers would be filled out when there were people who actually went in the field/lab and identified the species. Here you would list the people who did that work.\n\nGeneral Scope: You can add a description of the range of taxa addressed in the dataset or collection.\nIdentification Procedure: You can describe the methods used for taxonomic identification.\nIdentification Completeness: You can add information regarding completeness and uncertainty in the identifications.\n\nVoucher is where you can add information about specimens you submitted to a museum or a storage facility where you are storing specimens, can document that here (select a Repository via a Contact entered in mdEditor).",

Select the “Project” profile\nAfter initially creating your project record, but before you begin adding metadata, select the metadata record’s profile type. In the main menu’s Profile drop-down options, select “Project”. This will limit the number of available tabs and only show tabs that contain fields that are applicable to project metadata.\n\n\n\nAfter selecting the Project profile, only the relevant tabs will be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Ensure your Contacts are loaded into mdEditor\nIn mdEditor, contacts are created separately from individual records and then stored within a library in mdEditor. Once contacts have been entered or imported into mdEditor, they can be used in any metadata records.\nSA has a “seed list” of contacts that that contains standardized information for common partner agencies, USFWS regions, and the SA Network Data Steward. This Contacts Seed file (as a .json) can be downloaded from the mdEditor Seed Contacts item page. and then imported into mdEditor using the Import tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou should maintain a single list of your contacts. Having duplicate copies of the same contact is not desirable. It can create confusion as you edit and manage your metadata records and introduce unnecessary errors.",

    "section": "Funding Allocations",
    "text": "Funding Allocations\nAllocations describe where project funding came from, how much, where and when it was distributed. Science Catalog users can search by specific fiscal year, funders, or recipients.\nA funding allocation represents a single fiscal year, source, and recipient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you have two recipients in a single fiscal year, each needs to be added as separate funding allocations.\n\n\n\nRequired Fields\nFor each funding allocation, the following fields should be filled out.\n\n\nAmount (Required)\nEnter the amount of funding.\n\n\nCurrency (Required)\nBe sure U.S. Dollars is selected (i.e., Unites States of America, the–US Dollar; this is third from the bottom of USD options in mdEditor).\n\n\nAward ID (Required)\nThe Award ID numbers are internal codes that connect the distribution forms to the project metadata. Award IDs include grant or cooperative agreement numbers, contract numbers, or inter-agency agreement numbers. Inclusion of Award IDs provides accountability and allows tracking and auditing between financial systems and the Science Catalog.\nIf no Award ID exists, then the project is likely an internal effort. Enter ’None” in the Award ID field. This allows for tracking and search of internally funded projects.\n\n\nSource (Required)\nAdd the relevant contact for the “source” of the project funding. Source should be an organization, not an individual. For SA projects, the most common sources are U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, and Bureau of Reclamation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFunding source should always identify the agency or organization, rather than a sub-program or office. For example, all funding from other FWS programs need to list U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as the source (and not list the source as Fisheries, specific Refuges, ES, etc.). Clarifications on the exact program or office where the funding came from should be done through the Funding/Other Contacts field.\n\n\n\n\nRecipient (Required)\nAdd the relevant contact for the “recipient” of the project funding. Recipient should always be an organization, not an individual. For example, the Principal Investigator would not be listed as the recipient, but their organization would be. If there are multiple recipients for a project, they need to be added as separate allocations.\nYou could add the Principal Investigator in the Other Contacts field as “principalInvestigator.”\n\n\nOther Contacts (Required)\nIn most cases, a program or region has allocated the funding for a project. In order to track funds within regions and programs and provide proper credit, add the FWS region (yes, both the legacy region and the DOI unified region for now) as the funding “administrator” for all allocations. Recall that the funding source should identify the agency who supplied the funding (i.e. US Fish and Wildlife Service). Also, add the program name, if applicable, as the funding “administrator”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFunding administrator can also be used to differentiate funding from different programs/offices within the same agency. For example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service can be identified as the funding source and the funding administrator may also include “Ecological Services” or a specific field office.\n\n\n\n\nMarked Funding (If applicable)\nIn some cases, funds are marked for specific activities and include reporting requirements that accompany the funding allocations. For example, EPA allocates Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) funds on behalf of Congress to FWS, among others. FWS then distributes the funds across programs for use. The Gulf Coast Restore funds are a similar case. This funding flow can be tracked and aggregated with the Funding Other Contacts. Add the Name of the funding source as an organization contact and add the funding source as the “funder” in Funding Other Contacts.\n\n\n\nExample of organizational fund contact entry\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of organizational fund entry in Funding metadata entry\n\n\n\n\nMatching and In-kind Funds (If applicable)\nProject funds or in-kind support that were supplied by a partner (i.e., not specifically allocated to SA) should be included as an allocation as described above, but with the matching fund box checked. Each matching fund provider needs to be included as a separate allocation.\n\n\n\nExample of Matching Allocation Metadata entry",

If funds are provided from multiple sub-activities, please add this in the description (i.e. FWS sub-activity 1430, fundcode 170, $30,000: sub-activity 1420, fundcode 170, $10,000).

If you want greater detail, attach high-definition shapefiles instead of trying to draw them.\nExtents should be accurate enough for searching purposes, but remember that they are metadata, not data.\n\nOption 1: Import Spatial Features\nSpatial features such as geoJSON, shapefiles, and kml can be imported. However, file attributes (such as name and description), will not be imported and must be added manually.\nFor projects without a specific extent, you can use the FWS regional geography. Projects should have custom extents when it is relevant to the scope of the project. Remember, these extents will be used for search and discovery purposes. geoJSON files for all FWS regional and state geographies are available on ScienceBase (private DMWG folder that requires ScienceBase login).

Download script and other helpful files from GitHub.\n\nGo to https://github.com/mmheller/mdEditorFileInjector and download all the files.\n\n\n\nUnzip to any folder.\n\n\n\n\n2. Gather some mdEditor files for the demo test.\n\nCreate a folder named Demo somewhere convenient.\n\n\n\nCopy/paste 2-5 of YOUR mdEditor files into the Demo folder.\n\n\n\n\n3. Build the string that will have the necessary arguments to run the script.\n\nOpen any text editor (e.g., notepad) and enter the following letters with Dashes on separate lines (–C –D –F –f –T –O).\n\n\nFor reference, the final version will look like this. Follow the specific steps below to write each line.\n\n\nEnter the path to the Demo folder in line –C. Note: all files and files in subfolders will be processed by the script. No original files will be edited, copies will always be made.\n\n\n\nEnter “metadata|funding” in line –D. This is the location in the JSON that we’re telling the script to look for finding JSON text. Note: be sure to add double quotes for this argument.\nFor line –F\n\n\n\nCopy/paste the path to the unzipped folder with all the injector script files.\nAND copy/paste the file name inject_FundingAdministrator.txt\n\n\n\nMake sure to separate the path and filename with a back slash. This holds all the text we will inject.\n\nFor line –f, do the same thing but with the file name find_FundingAdminstrator.txt. This holds all the text the script uses to find text to replace.\nAdd False to the –T line. This indicates we’re not adding new contacts to the available contacts list.\nAdd 6 to the –O line. This specifies the option for the more complex find/replace.\n\n\n\n\n4. Edit the inject_FundingAdministrator.txt file with the Contact ID of your choice.\n\nOpen mdEditor, clear the cache, and then import one of the mdEditor files from the demo folder.\nHowever you want to do it, copy the Contact ID of your choice.\n\n\n\nOpen inject_FundingAdministrator.txt in a text editor and overwrite the Contact ID value in the file. Save and then close the file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe Contact ID you enter must be the same for all the mdEditor files you want to run through the processor (or are in the demo folder). If you have different Contact IDs to inject across different records, you must do these in separate iterations of the script with only the relevant mdEditor files for each contact ID. If you have different Contact IDs to add within the same record, you cannot use the script and must edit those records manually in mdEditor.\n\n\n\n\n5. Open the find_FundingAdminstrator.txt file.\nMake sure it says:\n\n\n\n6. Inspect one or more of the mdEditor files in mdEditor.\n\nGo to Funding. Choose an allocation where match is not selected and click “More.” Then click “Edit” for the allocation. Scroll down and notice no entries under “Other Contacts.”\n\n\n\n\n7. Run the script.\n\nBack in the text editor, add two blank lines in the beginning.\n\n\n\nFind the path to your python.exe and enter in the 1st line. Example: C:.exe\nFind the path to your .py injector script file and enter in the 2nd line. Note: this will be in the folder you downloaded and unzipped. Example: C:-master_v1.py\n\n\n\nRemove all the carriage returns and extra spaces, and save if desired. Note: if any of your file paths have spaces, make sure to enclose the full path/filename with double quotes.\n\n\n\nOpen a DOS prompt.\n\n\n\nCopy/paste the text from your text editor into the command prompt to run.\n\n\n\n\n8. Inspect the results.\n\nOpen mdEditor and clear the cache.\nClick Import. Go to the demo folder and into the new folder created. Note: each time the process runs it will create a new folder and add new files to this folder.\n\n\n\nSelect one of the new files to import.\nGo to Funding. Choose an allocation where match is not selected and click “More.” Then click “Edit” for the allocation. Scroll down and notice a new entry under “Other Contacts.”\n\n\nNote: If it errors out, there’s a problem.

Choose a project and its products to test.\nBest Management Practice: It’s recommended that you export a project and its products into its own mdEditor file. Set default parent identifier as a ScienceBase folder.\nIf you do already have items on ScienceBase, choose one of the following approaches. Note that this procedure may affect your existing records.\nApproach #1) Take a simple project and product set, and make a copy of the mdEditor records. In the test version, delete all ScienceBase IDs (SBIDs) and parent IDs. The SBID will either be located in the citation, or if you imported the record from SB, the SBID will be the record identifier. Set default parent identifier as a folder.\nApproach #2) Publish directly to a real record if you have confirmed a backup copy exists, in the event that the record is deleted in ScienceBase.\nSet your Default Parent Identifier in Settings / Publishing Settings.\nSelect one project with its associated products to test.\nFollow the publishing instructions above for the scenario that applies to you.\nLook for any errors in the third column. If you see an error that is 400 and red, it’s a problem that you can address. However, if it’s a 500 level error in red, that is a ScienceBase error that is outside the scope of the mdEditor.\n\nNOTE: Any unsolvable issues can be submitted on the issues page for mdEditor: https://github.com/adiwg/mdEditor/issues. You must have a github account in order to post. Advanced users can check errors using the browser console.\nVerify your test records have published as expected in your folder on ScienceBase (or to the real record if that’s how you are testing).\nAfter you are satisfied with how your test records published to ScienceBase, continue to step 10.\nUpdate your mdEditor Settings / Publishing Settings to your real Default Parent Identifier.\nUsing the record you just tested, proceed with publishing to the real location on ScienceBase.\nMake sure any test SBIDs are removed entirely from the record you want to actually publish.\nVerify that the real records have updated as expected.\nProceed with publishing your other records to their real locations. It is advisable to publish 1 or 2 records at a time, since ScienceBase can time-out and fail when publishing records simultaneously.",

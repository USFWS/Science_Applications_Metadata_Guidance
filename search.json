    "section": "",
    "text": "Digital Object Identifier (DOI)\nA Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a globally unique, persistent, and resolvable identifier used to uniquely identify objects and are widely used to identify academic, professional, and government information (e.g., journal articles, research reports, data sets, official publications). Think of it as a Social Security Number for your data. DOIs are standardized by the International Organization of Standards (ISO). DOIs are connected to the asset in perpetuity through a DOI hosting service (e.g., DataCite or CrossRef) that maintains the link to the resource.\nDOIs should be assigned to Service-funded assets such as dataset, services, models, and reports, with the exception of research publications where journals assign the DOIs. Using DOIs promotes discovery and re-useability of the Service’s work and investments in data and ensures appropriate recognition for those collecting and properly managing data assets.\nFor more information on DOIs, see Digital Object Identifier Handbook.\nThe Service Digital Object Identifier Management Tool enables Service personnel to assign DOIs, registered with DataCite, to Service-funded data products and other resources. This tool is used to mint (create), update, publish, administer, and search for Service DOIs. DOI required metadata includes the asset title, creator(s), publication date, type of data product, abstract, dates relevant to the resource, and an online link to the permanent repository location of resource and can be updated at any time.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Anatomy of a DOI URL\n\n\nFigure 1 from Alaska Region Interim Data Management User Guide\nOnce minted, the DOI is included as an identifier in your metadata record (Figure 2)\n\nThis Tool was developed and is managed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Science Analytics and Synthesis (SAS) Science Data Management Branch, under an interagency agreement with the Service.\nDOIs generated by this tool should be assigned to Service-funded data products (such as data releases, services, models, and reports), with the exception of primary research publications published in one of the Service’s journals which are assigned through a process governed by the National Conservation Training Center. To generate data product DOIs, you need to submit brief citation metadata, including the title, creator(s), publication date, type of data product, abstract, dates relevant to the data, and an online link to the data. These citation metadata can be updated at any time.\nBefore you being, collect required metadata information as follows:\n\n\n\nMetadata\nRequired?\n\n\n\n\nTitle\nRequired\n\n\nResource Type\nRequired\n\n\nPoint of Contact\nRequired\n\n\nDate\nRequired\n\n\nAbstract\nRequired\n\n\nRepository URL\nRequired\n\n\n\n\nCreating and maintaining a DOI\nThe DOI Tool is designed to be user friendly and guide you through the process to mint, populate metadata, publish, and administer DOIs. It is important to note that there is both a “beta” and “live” version of the DOI. The beta version is useful as a training resource to become familiar with the DOI Tool.. The live version is where you go to actually create a DOI, which can be set to hidden or public. DOIs assigned through the live version have a prefix of 10.7944.\nTo login to the DOI Tool:\n\nUse your Service email address and password. Once logged in, you will have “read-only” access to any record, “write” access to records that you created and to those where you have been added as a “Manager”.\n\n\nMinting a DOI\nMinting a DOI creates and reserves a DOI and DOI URL and does NOT require fully populated metadata fields. The benefit to minting the DOI early, such as in the Planning or Access Phase of the data lifecycle is efficiency. The DOI can be referencing in related documentation, metadata, and other elements of the project, reducing the need for updating later.\nTo mint a DOI, follow these steps:\n\nEnter our existing metadata into the DOI Tool following the instructions provided on the site. New users are encouraged to review the “NEW USER?” section in the login page (Figure 1). The DOI does not need to be published publicly until the DOI metadata is completed.\n\n\n\n\nNew User Instructions on the Login Page\n\n\nThe DOI is comprised of the resolvable service url, the registered prefix and a product identifier suffix (Figure 2). Service DOI are assigned the prefix of 10.7964. The DOI URL can be used as a weblink to the registered asset.\n\nOnce created, the DOI is ready for use asset related metadata, reports, publications, and other elements that need to refer to DOIs as soon as necessary.\nDuring the maintain phase of the data lifecycle, any empty fields in the DOI metadata should be updated.\nOnce the fields in the DOI metadata are fully populated, publish the DOI. This creates the digital tether to the URL for the data resource landing page.\nYou can administer the DOI at any time using the DOI tools dashboard(s). See the DOI Administration section below for more information.\nInclude the DOI as an identifier in your metadata record (Figure 2b). As an identifier, only the prefix and suffix are needed.\nInclude the DOI as an online resource in your metadata record (Figure 2c). In this case the entire DOI url is needed.\n\n\n\n\nINCORRECT DOI entry as identifier in metadata\n\n\n\n\n\nCORRECT DOI entry as identifier in metadata\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of DOI entered as both online resource and identifier\n\n\n\n\n\nDOI Administration\nThe Service has secured a large, yet limited bank (range) of DOIs. Once minted, the DOI is valid in perpetuity. If you are new to the DOI, please get familiar with the tool in the training beta version. When ready to officially reserve a DOI, use the live version of the tool. The DOI tool was not intended to be used do not for data assets that were not initiated, funded, or delivered as part of a Service project.\nTo date the Service has not identified a responsible party or governance for administering DOIs within the Service. As a result, the duties of DOI administration must fall to the collective of Service DOI creators/editors. DOI administration duties include:\nEnsuring minted DOIs are being used for their intended purpose, which includes:\n\nMinimizing the number of DOIs being minted and never published,\n\nEnsuring one DOI per digital object (e.g. research reports, data sets, service, etc.)\nEnsuring URL paths are still resolvable (no broken web links attached to the DOI)\n\nProviding usage reports\nHelping to reconcile previous DOIs from other DOI services\nEnhancing supplemental DOI metadata\n\nEach Service program, currently without enterprise level governance, has the option to administer the assignment of DOIs to their data assets within their program such that it meets their workflow. While the tool is available for any Service employee to login and create a DOI, a program may prefer to have a process to trigger a review or notification before a DOI is created. For example, an employee may login and create a DOI during planning set the DOI to hidden until the data and set edit rights to other accountable data staff. Once completed and approved, the DOI status can be set to public.\n\n\n\nExample of DOI Tool Dashboard\n\n\n\n\nBulk DOI Creation and Updates API\nThis tool also has an optional Web API (application programming interface) component for the automated creation and editing of DOIs and may be useful for bulk creation of DOIs through scripting/programming. After logging into the tool with your Department of Interior Active Directory credentials, see the DOI API link for more information.\n\n\n\nDOI API tool link indicated with red arrow",

You must import Settings to retain metadata repository information, default ScienceBase parent identifier, and auto-save preference. To import the Settings with an mdEditor file, set the import to “Replace” (be sure you have already saved a backup copy of any files currently in mdEditor). Set the mode back to “Merge” once you’ve finished importing the Settings.\nIf you have records already loaded into mdEditor with all desired Settings, then you do not need to re-import Settings when you import additional mdEditor files.\nSee next sections for specific file format import guidance on mdJSON, sbJSON, and FGDC metadata.",

    "text": "File management in mdEditor involves consistent and proper handling and storage of mdEditor derived formats of metadata. These files are essential for long-term access to metadata beyond a single work session.\n\n\nmdEditor stores information on your local computer in your browser’s localStorage cache (not the normal file cache). This means that if you use a different browser to access mdEditor, it will not show the metadata records from your original browser. It also means that clearing your browser’s cache generally will not delete your mdEditor records. However, depending on your browser’s settings, clearing your browser cache may still delete your mdEditor data (e.g., in Chrome, checking the “c_ookies and other site data_” option will clear your mdEditor data).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWarning: In mdEditor settings, you can clear your storage cache. Doing so will remove all of the information currently loaded in mdEditor. Reasons you might want to clear your storage cache is due to too much information stored in the cache, or as a way to debug a problem with mdEditor. It is very important that you back up your records before clearing the mdEditor cache to avoid losing your data. Consult the Export or Settings section of this manual to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe underlying format of the metadata from mdEditor is mdJSON, which was created specifically for mdEditor. There are two types of mdJSON files.\n\nmdJSON files are the format that is published from mdEditor and made available on ScienceBase and data.gov. Their default file name is md_metadata.json.\nmdEditor.json files are the files used by mdEditor. They contain extra information, such as settings, that tell mdEditor how to operate. Their default file name is mdeditor-timestamp.json.\n\nmdJSON files can be exported and imported via mdEditor’s built-in Export and Import functionality. The Export functionality allows you to back up and share your records between browsers. The Import functionality lets you load records into mdEditor, either from previously-saved mdEditor session, exported from another browser, or downloaded from ScienceBase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nJSON = JavaScript Object Notation, an open source file format. mdEditor produces mdJSON. ScienceBase has their own specific format, called sbJSON.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo keep file size manageable, it is recommended that you work on one project (and its related products and contacts) at a time. You should group said project, products, and contacts together using the same scheme that your LCC uses to organize data.\n\nSave each project and affiliated products together as a set. To do this, select “Export” from the top menu, then select the appropriate records (i.e., the target project and its affiliated products) and then click “Export Selected.”\nSave the resulting mdEditor JSON file to your hard drive in a working folder. There should be a separate mdEditor JSON file for each project and all of its products.\n\n\n\n\nIt is recommended that you leave your contacts in mdEditor between work sessions so that they will be available the next time you need to create metadata records. You can also export your contacts independently of your records for use between browsers.\nYou can also set up a metadata directory so you can always find the metadata file. This directory can be any folder on your local computer that is easily accessible and will not be deleted.\n\n\n\nWhen exporting products or projects, you should also export your entire contact list. If you do not export your contact list, and you later import a record that contains a contact not loaded in mdEditor, you may receive an error and have to re-create and re-enter the contact for that record.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf contacts records are re-created, it results in another mdEditor identifier being created for a contact, resulting in duplicate contacts. mdEditor does not know that this is an existing contact. You should maintain a single list of your contacts. Having duplicate copies of the same contact is not desirable. It can create confusion as you edit and manage your metadata records and introduce unnecessary errors.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintain an “Export All” JSON file each time you finish a work session in mdEditor (or switch browsers, URLs, etc.). This is the most efficient way to backup your records. For more information, consult Export.\nIt is particularly important that you export your records for backup before using mdEditor’s Clear Storage Cache functionality (clearing the storage cache will delete any records or data you have entered in mdEditor). Exporting ensures that your data is secure even after clearing the storage cache. Not exporting your data before clearing your cache will result in a permanent loss of records.

It is very important that you back up your records before clearing the mdEditor cache to avoid losing your data. Consult the Export or Settings section of this manual to learn more.",

    "text": "The underlying format of the metadata from mdEditor is mdJSON, which was created specifically for mdEditor. There are two types of mdJSON files.\n\nmdJSON files are the format that is published from mdEditor and made available on ScienceBase and data.gov. Their default file name is md_metadata.json.\nmdEditor.json files are the files used by mdEditor. They contain extra information, such as settings, that tell mdEditor how to operate. Their default file name is mdeditor-timestamp.json.\n\nmdJSON files can be exported and imported via mdEditor’s built-in Export and Import functionality. The Export functionality allows you to back up and share your records between browsers. The Import functionality lets you load records into mdEditor, either from previously-saved mdEditor session, exported from another browser, or downloaded from ScienceBase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nJSON = JavaScript Object Notation, an open source file format. mdEditor produces mdJSON.

    "text": "To keep file size manageable, it is recommended that you work on one project (and its related products and contacts) at a time. You should group said project, products, and contacts together using the same scheme that your LCC uses to organize data.\n\nSave each project and affiliated products together as a set. To do this, select “Export” from the top menu, then select the appropriate records (i.e., the target project and its affiliated products) and then click “Export Selected.”\nSave the resulting mdEditor JSON file to your hard drive in a working folder. There should be a separate mdEditor JSON file for each project and all of its products.\n\n\n\n\nIt is recommended that you leave your contacts in mdEditor between work sessions so that they will be available the next time you need to create metadata records. You can also export your contacts independently of your records for use between browsers.\nYou can also set up a metadata directory so you can always find the metadata file. This directory can be any folder on your local computer that is easily accessible and will not be deleted.\n\n\n\nWhen exporting products or projects, you should also export your entire contact list. If you do not export your contact list, and you later import a record that contains a contact not loaded in mdEditor, you may receive an error and have to re-create and re-enter the contact for that record.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf contacts records are re-created, it results in another mdEditor identifier being created for a contact, resulting in duplicate contacts. mdEditor does not know that this is an existing contact. You should maintain a single list of your contacts. Having duplicate copies of the same contact is not desirable. It can create confusion as you edit and manage your metadata records and introduce unnecessary errors.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintain an “Export All” JSON file each time you finish a work session in mdEditor (or switch browsers, URLs, etc.). This is the most efficient way to backup your records. For more information, consult Export.\nIt is particularly important that you export your records for backup before using mdEditor’s Clear Storage Cache functionality (clearing the storage cache will delete any records or data you have entered in mdEditor). Exporting ensures that your data is secure even after clearing the storage cache. Not exporting your data before clearing your cache will result in a permanent loss of records.

    "text": "We envision a well-functioning data management, integration, and sharing process that integrates, at minimum, the products of SA-funded projects with those from regionally-funded projects, and that support the data lifecycle in a coordinated manner.—Conservation Science Plan v.1\n\nIn the beginning, Science Applications was leading the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives: A network of individual, geographically distinct partnerships coordinated by SA. The 22 Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) developed uniquely and independently based on the needs of their regions and partnerships. As a result, there was not a single workflow for data management and sharing among the LCCs. Instead there were multiple workflows, varying formats, and different use cases for managing and sharing the results of LCC-funded projects. Further, because LCCs placed varying levels of importance on data management, LCCs varied greatly in their staff capacity for data management.\nWhile the individual workflows met the needs of the individual LCCs and their partner organizations, they were not enough to achieve the goal of a network-wide, integrated dynamic project and product database. Through collective agreement, LCCs agreed they needed to modify their workflows to create comparable project and product metadata.\nProcedurally, the LCC Network has committed to using ScienceBase for cataloging all funded projects and associated products. As per the LCC Network’s response to a DOI Office of the Inspector General 2017 report, individual LCCs must contribute their project and product metadata to the ScienceBase repository by the end of 2017 and mid-2018 respectively. In tandem with this ScienceBase requirement, the LCC Network is required to post data products to data.gov and this data conduit will be in place with products cataloged by end of 2018.\nWhile SA has refocused on FWS priorities, the need for data management, integration, and sharing process remains essential to mission of FWS and SA. This guidance was developed by the SA Data Management Working Group (DMWG) with the leadership of the Architecture Subgroup (ASG).\n\n\n\n\nObjective 1.1: Enable efficient and consistent searching and filtering across all SA projects and products&gt;\nObjective 1.2: Ensure resource managers and partners can continue to find and use LCC information and products for decision-making and conservation action on the landscape.\nObjective 1.3: Support users (e.g., resource managers, scientists, auditors, graduate students) in identifying remaining/future science needs and preventing future duplication of work by displaying who and what SA has funded.\nObjective 1.4: Ensure the SA Science Catalog instance will remain accessible through a portable design that can be hosted on fws.gov and elsewhere, if needed.\n\n\n\nObjective 2.1: Document how FWS and other sources of funding were used to fund science projects.\nObjective 2.2: Enable Science Applications and other key partners to show how FWS and other sources of funding were allocated to partners (e.g., states, tribes, federal agencies).\nObjective 2.3: Allow data managers to use the Science Catalog as an internal project tracking system.\n\n\n\nObjective 3.1: Enable Science Applications and other key partners to show how investments by FWS and other federal programs leveraged additional funding by partners.\nObjective 3.2: Demonstrate the depth and breadth of the projects and products produced by SA and the partners and collaborators involved.\n\n\n\nObjective 4.1: Link SA projects and products to overarching Conservation Issues.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Non Duplication Policy Guidance\n\nNon Duplication Policy\nBased on a 2017 OIG audit, minimal metadata fields are required to be published within 30-days of project funding. The purpose of this policy is to share information with partners regarding what science projects SA is supporting. This transparency helps to reduce duplication of efforts across funding agencies and allows partners to discover and engage in SA supported science as desired.\n\n\n\nQuick Reference: Project metadata for Non Duplication Policy\nRequired\n\n\n\n\nBasic Information: Title, Status\nRequired\n\n\nPoint of Contacts (see Main Tab: Project)\nRequired\n\n\nDescription: Abstract\nRequired\n\n\nTime Period\nRequired\n\n\nFunding: Award Number, amount, source, fiscal year, recipients\nRequired\n\n\n\nBelow is a copy of the Non Duplication Policy guidance memo, in detail for reference:\n\n\nGuidance for Preventing Duplication of Research and Other Science Activities\n\nBackground\nOn September 1, 2017, and December 7, 2017, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) issued memos detailing actions all Assistant Regional Directors, Science Applications (SA-ARDs), must take to prevent duplication of research across Science Applications and United States Geological Survey Climate Adaptation Science Centers (CASCs). This document provides further guidance for how to best comply with those memos, in addition to other measures that can be undertaken to prevent duplicative research across Science Applications, CASCs, and other federal programs. See this dashboard for a list of resources.\n\n\nSummary of Required Actions\nFor all financial assistance and inter-/intra-agency agreements or contracts for research projects and other science activities you must do what is outlined in the list below. Unless otherwise specified, the following applies to all science projects funded with SA applications monies (1410, 1420, and 1430):\n\nFirst determine if the project is a research project or other science activity. Consider whether the project will result in a science product (e.g. survey, study, tool, assessment, publication, etc.).\n\n\nIf you decide that it IS NOT research or another type of other science activity, document your decision using this template and attach it to the official award file.\n\n\nIf you decide that it IS research or another type of science activity, proceed with the steps outlined below.\nSearch for duplicative projects in ScienceBase (use the ScienceBase search template).\nAdd this language to the NOFO: “Applicants must document literature searches (e.g. academic literature, industry publication, ScienceBase, and Data.gov). Applicants should explain why their project is non-duplicative and how it will augment existing knowledge.”\nInclude peer review as part of project selection.\nYou must document consultation with the appropriate CASC director(s). Send an email to Anna-Marie York (Anna-Marie_York@fws.gov) to obtain an electronic form to document consultation with CASC directors. The form link can be shared with anyone in the Department of the Interior and offers the ability to create a spreadsheet that summarizes responses, including a time stamp for when each respondent completed the form.\nAfter consultation with CASCs is complete, the SA-ARD must provide a memo to the file (template here) certifying that consultation occurred. (Note: for grants and cooperative agreements the ARD may instead certify consultation was done by checking the appropriate box and signing the New Award Checklist - FWS Form 3-2460). Include a copy of the spreadsheet of responses as part of the official award file.\nEnter all project information into ScienceBase as soon as possible, but within 30 days of the agreement being in place (required per September 2017 memo). Provide as much information about projects as possible and update regularly, including adding entries for products within 30 days of receipt. See the ScienceBase Guidance section below for further details.\n\n\n\nRequired and Recommended Practices\nAs denoted by “(required)” in the list below, only practices 2, 5, and 6 are required per policy; the others are recommended but are not required. Note: required actions are the same as those listed above in the Summary of Required Actions. Unless otherwise specified, the following applies to all science projects funded with SA applications monies (1410, 1420, and 1430).\n\nDetermine if the project is a research project or other science activity (required). Consider whether the project will result in a science product (e.g. survey, study, tool, assessment, publication, etc.).\n\n\nIf you decide that it IS NOT research or another type of other science activity, document your decision using this template and attach it to the official award file (required).\n\n\nIf you decide that it IS research or another type of science activity, proceed with the steps outlined below.\nConsider coordinating with other federal agencies prior to the project funding phase:\n\nYou may consult informally during project development, or, when appropriate, invite staff from CASCs and other federal programs to be peer reviewers.\nWhen invited and able, consider participating in the project development and selection phases for other agencies’ research programs.\n\nSearch ScienceBase.gov for potentially duplicative projects prior to funding (required):\n\nDocument your search of ScienceBase using the ScienceBase search template.\n\n\nDo multiple searches (i.e. varying search terms and criteria) as necessary.\nBe expansive in your search – use a variety of search terms and limit the scope only as necessary. You should not limit your search to CASC communities.\n\n\n\nInclude copies of ScienceBase search template and corresponding results (spreadsheet) in the financial award file.\n\n\nRepeat Practice 2 at https://catalog.data.gov and any other relevant federal databases. You can use the ScienceBase search template to document these searches, though note that some of the instructions on the template are specific to ScienceBase.\nInsert this language in NOFO: “Applicants must document literature searchers (e.g. academic literature, industry publication, ScienceBase, and Data.gov). Applicants should explain why their project is non-duplicative and how it will augment existing knowledge.”(required)\nConsult with CASCs once you have selected a project to fund, but prior to funding. Email Anna-Marie_York@fws.gov to obtain a link to a form to send to CASC directors (required).\n\nUse the results of ScienceBase searches, informal consultations, and/or serving on review panels to identify CASCs that have funded similar research. You may also consider any CASC in your project geography. Aim to be expansive.\nConsider sending the form to leadership from other federal agencies as well.\nUsing google forms will allow us to download a spreadsheet of time-stamped responses. Email Anna_Marie_York@fws.gov for a copy of the resulting spreadsheet.\nInclude a copy of the responses (spreadsheet) in the financial award file.\n\nAfter consultation with CASCs is complete, the SA-ARD must provide a memo to the file (template here) certifying that consultation occurred. (Note: for grants and cooperative agreements the ARD may instead certify consultation was done by checking the appropriate box and signing the New Award Checklist - FWS Form 3-2460). Include a copy of the spreadsheet of responses as part of the official award file.\nEnter all project information into ScienceBase as soon as possible, but within 30 days of the agreement being in place (required per September 2017 memo). Provide as much information about projects as possible and update regularly, including adding entries for products within 30 days of receipt. See the ScienceBase Guidance section below for further details.\n\n\n\nScienceBase Guidance\n\nEvery region has folders in ScienceBase to put basic information about the science projects you have funded since September 30, 2017; per policy this is required within 30 days of funding a project or receiving a product. Here is what’s required for each project/product:\n\nTitle\nPI/funding recipient’s[1] name and contact info,\nPI/Funding recipient’s organization,\nstart date,\nprojected end date,\nabstract,\naward ID,\nfunding sources and amounts.\n\nYou can use mdEditor to make the records if that is your preference, or do it directly in ScienceBase. Here is a video tutorial showing how to enter directly on ScienceBase.\nIf you have a science activity that more than one FWS region contributed funds to, but there was a “lead region” that actually administered a single financial award / contract, then that lead region should create and maintain a single record in ScienceBase for the project and its products. The project record should list the total amount of Service funds in the financial / award contract (i.e., all regions combined).\nIf you have a science activity with multiple financial awards / contracts, then each award / contract should have its own ScienceBase record (note: modifications ARE NOT considered new awards / contracts). Whichever region administered each financial award / contract should create and maintain project and product records in ScienceBase. Please include the ScienceBase URL(s) for the related projects in the abstract. Example language: “this project is part of a larger initiative; you can find related records here: URL 1, URL 2, …”).\nIf you need “editing” access to your region’s ScienceBase folder…email Jill (jillian_cohen@fws.gov).\nIf you want a little more detail about what the “ScienceBase” policy is…Start with slides from a presentation Jill gave to the Data Management Working Group August 2018.\nIf you want all the details about the non-duplication policies…This dashboard is your gateway.\nIf you read through the slides and other documents and still have questions, or just want to check to make sure you’re doing things right call or email Jill (jillian_cohen@fws.gov; 703.358.1764).\n\n[1] The memo itself uses the term “project leader” instead of PI/funding recipient.",

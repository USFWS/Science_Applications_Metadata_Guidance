    "text": "Non Duplication Policy Guidance\n\nNon Duplication Policy\nBased on a 2017 OIG audit, minimal metadata fields are required to be published within 30-days of project funding. The purpose of this policy is to share information with partners regarding what science projects SA is supporting. This transparency helps to reduce duplication of efforts across funding agencies and allows partners to discover and engage in SA supported science as desired.\n\n\n\nQuick Reference: Project metadata for Non Duplication Policy\nRequired\n\n\n\n\nBasic Information: Title, Status\nRequired\n\n\nPoint of Contacts (see Main Tab: Project)\nRequired\n\n\nDescription: Abstract\nRequired\n\n\nTime Period\nRequired\n\n\nFunding: Award Number, amount, source, fiscal year, recipients\nRequired\n\n\n\nBelow is a copy of the Non Duplication Policy guidance memo, in detail for reference:\n\n\nGuidance for Preventing Duplication of Research and Other Science Activities\n\nBackground\nOn September 1, 2017, and December 7, 2017, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) issued memos detailing actions all Assistant Regional Directors, Science Applications (SA-ARDs), must take to prevent duplication of research across Science Applications and United States Geological Survey Climate Adaptation Science Centers (CASCs). This document provides further guidance for how to best comply with those memos, in addition to other measures that can be undertaken to prevent duplicative research across Science Applications, CASCs, and other federal programs. See this dashboard for a list of resources.\n\n\nSummary of Required Actions\nFor all financial assistance and inter-/intra-agency agreements or contracts for research projects and other science activities you must do what is outlined in the list below. Unless otherwise specified, the following applies to all science projects funded with SA applications monies (1410, 1420, and 1430):\n\nFirst determine if the project is a research project or other science activity. Consider whether the project will result in a science product (e.g. survey, study, tool, assessment, publication, etc.).\n\n\n If you decide that it IS NOT research or another type of other science activity, document your decision using [this template](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/NationalScienceApplicationsTeam/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BCBE94F78-67C1-478F-9A3A-DD264F031155%7D&file=SA_nonDup_policy_notScienceActivity_note_to_file_template_v2.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) and attach it to the official award file.\n\n\n\nIf you decide that it IS research or another type of science activity, proceed with the steps outlined below.\n\n Search for duplicative projects in ScienceBase \\(use the [ScienceBase search template](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/NationalScienceApplicationsTeam/Shared%20Documents/NonDuplication%20Policy%20Resources/All%20Other%20SA%20NonDuplication%20Policy%20Documents/Search%20Documentation%20Template_clean.docx?d=wfec340115ba14373b7cd9ecb92e309ac&csf=1&e=dyVjxv)\\).\nAdd this language to the NOFO: “Applicants must document literature searches (e.g. academic literature, industry publication, ScienceBase, and Data.gov). Applicants should explain why their project is non-duplicative and how it will augment existing knowledge.”\nInclude peer review as part of project selection.\nYou must document consultation with the appropriate CASC director(s). Send an email to Anna-Marie York (Anna-Marie_York@fws.gov) to obtain an electronic form to document consultation with CASC directors. The form link can be shared with anyone in the Department of the Interior and offers the ability to create a spreadsheet that summarizes responses, including a time stamp for when each respondent completed the form.\nAfter consultation with CASCs is complete, the SA-ARD must provide a memo to the file (template here) certifying that consultation occurred. (Note: for grants and cooperative agreements the ARD may instead certify consultation was done by checking the appropriate box and signing the New Award Checklist - FWS Form 3-2460). Include a copy of the spreadsheet of responses as part of the official award file.\n Enter all project information into ScienceBase as soon as possible, but within 30 days of the agreement being in place \\(required per [September 2017 memo](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/sites/NationalScienceApplicationsTeam/Shared%20Documents/General/Financial%20Resources/Non-duplication%20Policies/All%20Other%20SA%20NonDuplication%20Policy%20Documents/ClimateEffectsPrograms_042017_Public.pdf?CT=1586191476056&OR=ItemsView)\\). Provide as much information about projects as possible and update regularly, including adding entries for products within 30 days of receipt. See the ScienceBase Guidance section below for further details. \n\n\n\nRequired and Recommended Practices\nAs denoted by “(required)” in the list below, only practices 2, 5, and 6 are required per policy; the others are recommended but are not required. Note: required actions are the same as those listed above in the Summary of Required Actions. Unless otherwise specified, the following applies to all science projects funded with SA applications monies (1410, 1420, and 1430).\n\n Determine if the project is a research project or other science activity \\(required\\). Consider whether the project will result in a science product \\(e.g. survey, study, tool, assessment, publication, etc.\\).\n\n\n If you decide that it IS NOT research or another type of other science activity, document your decision using [this template](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/NationalScienceApplicationsTeam/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BCBE94F78-67C1-478F-9A3A-DD264F031155%7D&file=SA_nonDup_policy_notScienceActivity_note_to_file_template_v2.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) and attach it to the official award file \\(required\\).\n\n\n\nIf you decide that it IS research or another type of science activity, proceed with the steps outlined below.\n\n Consider coordinating with other federal agencies prior to the project funding phase:\n\nYou may consult informally during project development, or, when appropriate, invite staff from CASCs and other federal programs to be peer reviewers.\nWhen invited and able, consider participating in the project development and selection phases for other agencies’ research programs.\n\nSearch ScienceBase.gov for potentially duplicative projects prior to funding (required):\n\n\n Document your search of ScienceBase using the [ScienceBase search template](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/NationalScienceApplicationsTeam/Shared%20Documents/NonDuplication%20Policy%20Resources/All%20Other%20SA%20NonDuplication%20Policy%20Documents/Search%20Documentation%20Template_clean.docx?d=wfec340115ba14373b7cd9ecb92e309ac&csf=1&e=dyVjxv).\n\n\n\nDo multiple searches (i.e. varying search terms and criteria) as necessary.\nBe expansive in your search – use a variety of search terms and limit the scope only as necessary. You should not limit your search to CASC communities.\n\n\n\n Include copies of [ScienceBase search template](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/NationalScienceApplicationsTeam/Shared%20Documents/NonDuplication%20Policy%20Resources/All%20Other%20SA%20NonDuplication%20Policy%20Documents/Search%20Documentation%20Template_clean.docx?d=wfec340115ba14373b7cd9ecb92e309ac&csf=1&e=dyVjxv) and corresponding results \\(spreadsheet\\) in the financial award file.\n\n\n Repeat Practice 2 at [https://catalog.data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov) and any other relevant federal databases. You can use the [ScienceBase search template](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/NationalScienceApplicationsTeam/Shared%20Documents/NonDuplication%20Policy%20Resources/All%20Other%20SA%20NonDuplication%20Policy%20Documents/Search%20Documentation%20Template_clean.docx?d=wfec340115ba14373b7cd9ecb92e309ac&csf=1&e=dyVjxv) to document these searches, though note that some of the instructions on the template are specific to ScienceBase.\nInsert this language in NOFO: “Applicants must document literature searchers (e.g. academic literature, industry publication, ScienceBase, and Data.gov). Applicants should explain why their project is non-duplicative and how it will augment existing knowledge.”(required)\nConsult with CASCs once you have selected a project to fund, but prior to funding. Email Anna-Marie_York@fws.gov to obtain a link to a form to send to CASC directors (required).\n\nUse the results of ScienceBase searches, informal consultations, and/or serving on review panels to identify CASCs that have funded similar research. You may also consider any CASC in your project geography. Aim to be expansive.\nConsider sending the form to leadership from other federal agencies as well.\nUsing google forms will allow us to download a spreadsheet of time-stamped responses. Email Anna_Marie_York@fws.gov for a copy of the resulting spreadsheet.\nInclude a copy of the responses (spreadsheet) in the financial award file.\n\nAfter consultation with CASCs is complete, the SA-ARD must provide a memo to the file (template here) certifying that consultation occurred. (Note: for grants and cooperative agreements the ARD may instead certify consultation was done by checking the appropriate box and signing the New Award Checklist - FWS Form 3-2460). Include a copy of the spreadsheet of responses as part of the official award file.\n Enter all project information into ScienceBase as soon as possible, but within 30 days of the agreement being in place \\(required per [September 2017 memo](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/sites/NationalScienceApplicationsTeam/Shared%20Documents/General/Financial%20Resources/Non-duplication%20Policies/All%20Other%20SA%20NonDuplication%20Policy%20Documents/ClimateEffectsPrograms_042017_Public.pdf?CT=1586191476056&OR=ItemsView)\\). Provide as much information about projects as possible and update regularly, including adding entries for products within 30 days of receipt. See the ScienceBase Guidance section below for further details. \n\n\n\nScienceBase Guidance\n\nEvery region has folders in ScienceBase to put basic information about the science projects you have funded since September 30, 2017; per policy this is required within 30 days of funding a project or receiving a product. Here is what’s required for each project/product:\n\nTitle\nPI/funding recipient’s[1] name and contact info,\nPI/Funding recipient’s organization,\nstart date,\nprojected end date,\nabstract,\naward ID,\nfunding sources and amounts.\n\nYou can use mdEditor to make the records if that is your preference, or do it directly in ScienceBase. Here is a video tutorial showing how to enter directly on ScienceBase.\nIf you have a science activity that more than one FWS region contributed funds to, but there was a “lead region” that actually administered a single financial award / contract, then that lead region should create and maintain a single record in ScienceBase for the project and its products. The project record should list the total amount of Service funds in the financial / award contract (i.e., all regions combined).\nIf you have a science activity with multiple financial awards / contracts, then each award / contract should have its own ScienceBase record (note: modifications ARE NOT considered new awards / contracts). Whichever region administered each financial award / contract should create and maintain project and product records in ScienceBase. Please include the ScienceBase URL(s) for the related projects in the abstract. Example language: “this project is part of a larger initiative; you can find related records here: URL 1, URL 2, …”).\nIf you need “editing” access to your region’s ScienceBase folder…email Jill (jillian_cohen@fws.gov).\nIf you want a little more detail about what the “ScienceBase” policy is…Start with slides from a presentation Jill gave to the Data Management Working Group August 2018.\nIf you want all the details about the non-duplication policies…This dashboard is your gateway.\nIf you read through the slides and other documents and still have questions, or just want to check to make sure you’re doing things right…Call or email Jill (jillian_cohen@fws.gov; 703.358.1764).\n\n[1] The memo itself uses the term “project leader” instead of PI/funding recipient.",

    "text": "We envision a well-functioning data management, integration, and sharing process that integrates, at minimum, the products of SA-funded projects with those from regionally-funded projects, and that support the data lifecycle in a coordinated manner.—Conservation Science Plan v.1\n\nIn the beginning, Science Applications was leading the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives: A network of individual, geographically distinct partnerships coordinated by SA. The 22 Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) developed uniquely and independently based on the needs of their regions and partnerships. As a result, there was not a single workflow for data management and sharing among the LCCs. Instead there were multiple workflows, varying formats, and different use cases for managing and sharing the results of LCC-funded projects. Further, because LCCs placed varying levels of importance on data management, LCCs varied greatly in their staff capacity for data management.\nWhile the individual workflows met the needs of the individual LCCs and their partner organizations, they were not enough to achieve the goal of a network-wide, integrated dynamic project and product database. Through collective agreement, LCCs agreed they needed to modify their workflows to create comparable project and product metadata.\nProcedurally, the LCC Network has committed to using ScienceBase for cataloging all funded projects and associated products. As per the LCC Network’s response to a DOI Office of the Inspector General 2017 report, individual LCCs must contribute their project and product metadata to the ScienceBase repository by the end of 2017 and mid-2018 respectively. In tandem with this ScienceBase requirement, the LCC Network is required to post data products to data.gov and this data conduit will be in place with products cataloged by end of 2018.\nWhile SA has refocused on FWS priorities, the need for data management, integration, and sharing process remains essential to mission of FWS and SA. This guidance was developed by the SA Data Management Working Group (DMWG) with the leadership of the Architecture Subgroup (ASG).\n\n\n\n\nObjective 1.1: Enable efficient and consistent searching and filtering across all SA projects and products&gt;\nObjective 1.2: Ensure resource managers and partners can continue to find and use LCC information and products for decision-making and conservation action on the landscape.\nObjective 1.3: Support users (e.g., resource managers, scientists, auditors, graduate students) in identifying remaining/future science needs and preventing future duplication of work by displaying who and what SA has funded.\nObjective 1.4: Ensure the SA Science Catalog instance will remain accessible through a portable design that can be hosted on fws.gov and elsewhere, if needed.\n\n\n\nObjective 2.1: Document how FWS and other sources of funding were used to fund science projects.\nObjective 2.2: Enable Science Applications and other key partners to show how FWS and other sources of funding were allocated to partners (e.g., states, tribes, federal agencies).\nObjective 2.3: Allow data managers to use the Science Catalog as an internal project tracking system.\n\n\n\nObjective 3.1: Enable Science Applications and other key partners to show how investments by FWS and other federal programs leveraged additional funding by partners.\nObjective 3.2: Demonstrate the depth and breadth of the projects and products produced by SA and the partners and collaborators involved.\n\n\n\nObjective 4.1: Link SA projects and products to overarching Conservation Issues.",

    "text": "Note: This is a working draft that will continue to be edited. Last updated: 20 February 2024. Please refresh this manual every time you open it to ensure you are viewing the most recent version.\nIf you have questions/concerns regarding this guidance, please contact the FWS SA National Data Steward (sadatasteward@fws.gov) or Blake Massey (blake_massey@fws.gov until 20 April 2024).\n\n\nThis manual describes the requirements and best practices for the creation of high-quality and consistent metadata records for projects and products for USFWS Science Applications. These metadata requirements conform to the standardized metadata format agreed upon by the SA Data Management Working Group and meets USFWS policy requirements for data management. This metadata drives the unified SA Science Catalog, where SA projects and products are discoverable, accessible, and usable.\n\n\n\nMetadata creation is part of the Maintain step of the Data Management Lifecycle.\nGuidance is also available in the USFWS data management handbook.\n\n\nThe metadata editing tool employed to create and support metadata requirements is mdEditor. This tool was an extension of an initiative by the Alaska Data Integration Working Group (ADIwg) and adopted by SA.\nThis manual refers to the creation of SA metadata specifically. If you want information on the creation of other metadata records using mdEditor, or more information in general, please refer to the mdEditor User Manual.\n\n\n\n\nThis guide is for anyone creating or updating metadata for SA-related projects and products. The primary purpose is to describe in detail how to develop metadata for items for inclusion in the SA Science Catalog, but the tool can also be used to track any project or funding.\nThe metadata requirements described here apply to science projects and products that were funded by SA (for more details, see the Project, Products, and Contacts section).\n\n\n\nDirectly accessing this manual from the internet is the recommended way to use this manual. By doing so, you will guarantee that you are using the current version since it is a live document and any updates can be made instantly. The online version will also have the best functionality and graphical display.\nIf needed, you can download this manual as a PDF and save a copy to your computer for printing or offline use. If you choose this method, be sure to reference the online version regularly and save a new PDF as updates are made to the online version. Also note that not all of the formatting will be exactly the same as the online version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSome of the stylized text boxes (like this one) will not translate to the PDF exactly. The text will still be outlined with a background color, but the icon above the text will not display in the PDF.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis manual was developed while mdEditor was also being developed. Due to this, there may be minor discrepancies between screenshots in the manual and the current production version of mdEditor.",
